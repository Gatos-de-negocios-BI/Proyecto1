Second of all: I never went to a doctor to see if I really have some form of depression (I think I do, but... Whatever) so I'm not sure but... I just don't care anymore, you know? I have this thing that somedays, the only thing that makes me avoid suicide is fear for whats coming next (Thank you anxiety, very cool) and that scares me. Recently I started some ""studies"" (I just started reading random shit) on Nihilism and I definily agree with the argument that life has no meaning. I feel like that since I was 10. I'm 17 now and sometimes is so fucking hard just to cope with people around me. I have to constantly hide what I really feel, sometimes using the ""dark thoughs"" in my mind to make jokes, since people just don't believe me. I think that they will believe when I die.
It's 3 AM here and I can't sleep.
This will be the worst year in my life and I honestly don't know if I'll make it.
P.S: Don't talk about my family, I hate them and they do not care. I'm just the guy they are taking care of, so they can put all of the unfinished dreams they have on me and use me as a trophy. I hate both of my parentes almost as I hate myself.",suicide

293747,"27f struggling to find meaning moving forwardI admit this is a bit of a long rant, so thank you anyone who manages to read through it.  I really appreciate it.

Anyway, I have quite a few good things in my life, including good friends and a loving family, but if you ask me what dreams truly get me up in the morning with the will to live, there are two (albeit corny) answers: pursuing a career in writing, and the idea of falling in love with the girl of my dreams.

In High School I decided I was going to make at least one of those two dreams come true, so I earned a writing degree and started posting my work online.  It was...marginally successful.  In the years since I graduated I've averaged a little under $10,000 a year between my own projects and freelance projects.  Then the pandemic hit, and my income completely fizzled out.  Now I haven't been hired since June and am living with my parents to make ends meet.  I was already getting fatigued marching forward on so little income, now I'm wondering what the heck will even be left after this whole pandemic subsides.  I made the decision a month ago to start applying for a regular old 9-5 job, but it feels like it's crushing me.  It's not that I dislike the jobs I'm applying for, it's just that this dream has been the one thing giving me purpose, the thing I've worked 80 hours a week for and poured my soul into, and it's hard to imagine relegating it to a side project I may or may not have time or energy for anymore depending on what day job I land.

Unfortunately, the love side has been even less successful.  Dating with social anxiety is hard, dating while gay with social anxiety is harder, dating while gay with social anxiety while also trying to explain that you're not financially stable right now is even harder than that.  Needless to say I still haven't found that dream girl and probably won't for a while.

I know my dreams are a bit childish, and I feel guilty that having a loving family and the essentials of life don't feel like enough, but the reality is I feel like I'm barely functioning right now.  I'm trying to move forward imagining a new life that may not have either of those things I wanted.  However, it quickly starts to feel like the life I always feared: waking up in the morning to go to a job I'm lukewarm about only to come home, slog around my apartment alone, and then go to bed so I can do it all over again the next day.  I need a new meaning, one that's actually in my control, but I'm being sucked down into the abyss with this much faster than I can handle.",suicide

195945,"Little brother is self mutilating. Please help me!!!My brother is 15 year old. I'm 3 years older. For the past 3 years we have been dealing with our terminally ill father and witnessed a lot of suffering. Our family is in flames. We're going through financial difficulties and have to witness our father's situation. When dad was diagnosed I was his age, but it was way easier for me to cope with it because it was not as serious as it is now and I was always a bit more mature.

I feel shitty. When we were younger we fought a lot, often got physical. It was never really intense  (never punched him in the face, left him bleeding or seriously injured him). We haven't physically fought in years now but I can't help but feel I'm a part of this. I have always had a really short temper with him but I've been trying to fix it. It's involuntary, sometimes he screws things up and I cannot control it. He has severe ADHD since he was a kid. Sometimes when he does something like not picking up my calls when I'm going to pick him up at school I yell for a minute. He has not fought back in years and it makes me feel sick, I do not want him to be scared at me or just accept that someone yells at him.

He never went good at school, flunked twice when he was just a little kid. He is a really fun kid though, everyone likes him. I've been through similar experiences: being the fun kid, liked by everyone, never took things seriously and used comedy to mask every single insecurity I had - but it never got as serious at it is with him.

He had been cutting himself with a razor blade a few months ago, stopped, started seeing a therapist but now he's doing it again. Cuts his inner thigh and his stomach according to my mother. I have no clue on how to approach him or give him subtle hints that everything will be okay. I'm not looking for validation, I'm a narcissistic piece of shit and I legitimately think I have some fault in this. I don't really know how brothers fight but we had excellent education at home.

I love him, I wish it was me going through that. What can I do????

33987,"I hate my birthday. My life is looking darker as the years go byThis literally just came to mind I’m turning 20 in 2021(February)and I don’t look forward to it. My first memory of me on my birthday was when I was 4 my parents took me to the movies to watch racing stripes, to be honest I was a mischievous child I won’t sit still and ran all over the cinema. My dad then grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the cinema yelling at me I’m crying, he then took me to the car and locked me inside and went back to finish the movie. I’m sitting in the car crying with no windows opened after we went home he “disciplined” me. To this day I even remembered what he said “ I don’t care if it’s your birthday, I will plaster you against that wall (we had concrete walls)”as I’m crying because of the belt marks on my back he screams “ don’t you dare talk back to me I promise you, if you carry on you will die tonight”. My birthday this year all I wanted was to relax and watch T.V I couldn’t even do that I spend the whole day doing my brother’s (15) project, not helping, DOING. None of my friends even called or texted me happy birthday(on my birthday in 2018 - last year of high school, the last time even heard from my friends no one even wished me and we all where ID cards that display our D.O.B), maybe because I wasn't one of the popular guys, I'm always the one getting left out. I actually found out my friend group had a group chat, I never even knew about it. On my birthday this year the whole day was filled with yelling, swearing and violence. I got so angry that I took it out on myself, and that alone just brought back memories of me self harming, I used to cut and burn myself I even tied fish tank tubing to a stick and whipped myself with it. I’m turning 20 next year I don’t know where my life is going, I was meant to finish university next year instead I failed and repeating it, I just feel like I'm wasting everyones time and money.

My parents are cold and distant, and are ashamed of me and my failing grades. They brought me into existence, I should try to strive for successes- I feel guilty all of the time. I used to think I could finish high school and move before killing myself, because it would be less traumatic for my brothers and parents, but I see no reason to live or get up in the mornings even now. Nothing is interesting, nothing matters. I hate talking about my feelings, because my parents and friends would tell other people my problems. They secretly scoff at my weaknesses. I am so vulnerable and weak. Perhaps partially from my distant parents, I do not have any desire in having close relationships. I also hate feeling happy or smiling, as the guilt of not producing my potential is awful. I have a therapist, and didn't talk about my feelings at all- she would probably tell my parents, as I have no legal say in the matter. She knows that I don't want friends or connections, and keeps asking me if I enjoy hurting animals. She thinks I am a psychopath. Im scared she'll diagnose me as one and I'll have this label that isn't true following me around. I just want people to leave me alone. I want to kill myself all of the time- nothing is worthwhile.

I want to be dead. I wish I had never been alive at all. My childhood was great, my teen years a dream. My early twenties were spent having adventures with the love of my life. We traveled and partied and lived without a care in the world. I had more friends than I could count including a few best friends that were the funniest, coolest, and most caring girls I've ever known.
I'm attractive. I had a silly and easygoing personality. I had a crazy job that I was totally unqualified for but managed to impress everyone anyway.
Then I got pregnant. I never wanted children. I cried for days after finding out. My boyfriend was beside himself with excitement. I sucked it up and put on my mom of the year hat. Godawful pregnancy followed by colicky baby. But oh! She is so sweet and beautiful! She looks just like me. She has my personality, too. Wild and crazy and passionate and full of dreams.
My life is perfect. My husband works hard and provides us with everything we could ever want. I stay home with my three year old. I fucking hate my life. I hate being a mom. I hate being a wife. I hate granite countertops and organic vegetables and swimming lessons and play dates and vaccination debates. I've developed drug resistant hypertension 180/120 medicated and sinus tachycardia 150bpm. I'm so fucking tired all the time. I can't think straight and my memory is failing. I love my little girl and husband so much. Everyone thinks I'm super mom and tells me how jealous they are of my perfect life.
I just want to be dead. I'm not afraid of dying, of the pain, or the nothingness, even hell. How could I do that to my baby? How can I not?

It’s been rough, and it did almost end with a suicide attempt that I was talked out of over the phone. I live in Canada, and so thanksgiving was today.

When I was told to come downstairs I was asked “Do you know where the seeds are?” (Seeds being a salad topping) and I answered “No” annoyed because I literally never used them. And they told me to leave, and not come back to the table, I got angry because I’d just done yard work for a while and it’s getting cold. They starting making shit up, like “You’re already angry with us” and I made it very clear I was only angry when they started yelling at me to leave.

I asked my older brother for help here because I knew I was losing it, and instead of saying something to calm me down, he picked their side.

I said one fucking word and they’re trying to kick me out of the table.

And I started getting very angry, and I have very clear anger phases.

1-2 I’m annoyed
3-4 I’m angry but you can’t see it
5-6 You can tell I’m kinda angry
7-8 I’m stating to do my quiet yell
9-10 I get loud, loud. And I mean the neighbours in sound proof rooms can hear me.

I was a 10 when she said the words “You’re abusive”

They’ve done so much shit to hurt me, year after year I’ve just taken it.

I just called the bitch a whore.

I don’t call women whores ever, I’ve never even said the word before

I got crying angry, I honestly thought about murdering them. No not like the edgy 12 year old murder, I mean I was actually thinking about taking a knife and fucking stabbing them.

Yeah. That’s how much they’ve fucked me up.

Now they’re trying to convince me to come back downstairs to talk it out, and I’ve made it clear I’m done trying to talk to them, I’m done being their family, and I’m going to try and convince my brother to make him my legal guardian so I can finally stop living like they own me.

I don’t know where I’m going from here, if anything happens like this again I might just end up killing myself. I don’t think I can ever get over this, I’m going to be stuck here forever.

I’m not lying, making this story up for Reddit, I’m a real person, this is a real story, these are my real thoughts.

And before you say “Call the police” it’s not as easy as that. My parents will take each other’s side and they’re often believed more than any kid. They get my brother in their side, the only thing to back me up is years worth of Hearsay.

My family is shattered from the loss. My mom had to sell her business, and I am just here trying my best to juggle school, work, picking up the slack from everything else my dad left for us, and caring for my mom whenever she becomes really sad. School is easy enough, work is grudgingly mundane, but the hardest part is seeing my mom be broken, deteriorate ; ie she is losing a lot of weight, and not be able to help her whatsoever. Sure I know the errands I do have a direct effect on her but she still cries every night and it drives me to insanity. I obviously can't expect her to suddenly be ok and not cry anymore for an extremely long time, but that and the simple fact that I miss the person in my life that made me who I am is crippling. I turned 21 a month after my dad died, and I had to start school because I registered shortly prior before his loss, and all of those experiences distracted me from as well as amplified the reality that I will never be in contact with this person again.

Ive been thinking that I want to join my dad. However I saw a post here that talked about contemplating taking your own life but stopping yourself because you don't want to make life much harder for those you leave behind. And I think that is a big reason why I'm even here. The sheer thought of how my mom would be if I committed suicide is unbearable, and my brother, my friends.

However at the same time I feel like this traps me because I feel a sense of true isolation and loneliness because before my father passed I was hardly relatable as is, and now with my Father's sudden passing I feel that absolutely no one whatsoever will relate to me at all. Everyone insists either indirectly or directly, for me to simply ""get over it"" or ""accept it"" and move on. And this pushes me further away from society and reality because this is undisputable truth that they do not understand what I am going through. And I've tried reconciling and accommodating that ideal because I feel that it is more or less the true, objective way to react to a situation like this, but it just feels impossible for me. I just feel so alone. None of my closest friends have gone through something like this.

Well, here I am. I've been dealing with depression and social anxiety for three years, I've been hospitalized three times, and I've tried medications and therapy for most of those three years. Since I'm here on this subreddit, you can gather that it isn't working. It all got amplified when I arrived at university this past August, as two of those hospitalizations happened last semester. I hobbled through the first semester, but I've bombed this second one. I haven't been to class for most of the semester so far mainly due to those depression and social anxiety symptoms. I've made use of on-campus resources and have been seeing a therapist weekly for a few months now, and still I'm falling apart. By falling apart, I mean having suicidal thoughts every day because I fail every goal I set out for myself, be it go talk to a professor, or do a single assignment. I have suicidal thoughts that scream inside of my head whenever I am around people, so much so that I actually get itchy all over, like I can feel my hair growing. The only way to get any respite from the intense thoughts is for me to either work out or play video games. Those were the only times in the past six weeks when I haven't been actively planning my suicide. As a result of falling apart, I've engaged in a lot of self-destructive behaviors, including, but certainly not limited to, skipping class, binge eating, browsing memes excessively, and sleeping for 18 hours at a time. Since I'm on course to fail this semester and lose my financial aid, I pretty much have no choice but to drop out. I'd rather not deal with what my parents have to say about that, so I'm planning on killing myself so that I don't have to deal with the shame and embarrassment of being a dropout in my family and the only dropout among my ""friend"" groups. Neither of my parents have been all that supportive of me getting help for my mental health, but I figure that they would rather have a ""dead college student"" son than a ""mentally-wrecked dropout"" son.

Besides that, there's also the whole ""I can't talk to people, much less anyone to whom I'm attracted"" deal, which, coupled with the chronic nature of my mental illnesses, leads me to believe that (1) I am a broken and weak man-child who (2) will never find someone that loves him because he will never be free of this depression and, consequently, never be strong/brave enough to initiate any sort of romantic relationship. Maintaining one would be something else entirely. After all, how could anyone love someone as mentally fucked as I am?

&amp;nbsp;

For better or for worse, I happen to have two REALLY solid friends who have helped me focus and prioritize somewhat, but at this point, the work is too much to make up. They both helped me to see alternatives to my situation that aren't death, such as transferring to another college or taking a year off to establish strong mental health before trying college again, but they were only appealing when I had any hope of staying at my current college, of fixing my current situation. Now that those chances are out of the window, I see suicide as FAR more preferable than dropping out and dealing with parents or trying to piece together a life for myself when I had such high aspirations.

&amp;nbsp;

Since tomorrow is the last day I intend to remain among the living, I have a baller-ass day planned out to send myself off. Firstly, I'll shave. I'll write one last poem, read some Don Quixote, see a movie for the first time in months, and write my last letters to my solid friends and my parents. I'll listen to the Mass Effect 1 soundtrack again, as well as my exquisite (read: *mostly Lil B, Lil Debbie, Lil Ugly Mane, 2Pac, 3Pac, and Michael Jackson*) music playlist. I'll also tell this one lady who I like how I actually feel about her. Normally, I would be paralyzed with fear at the thought, but since I'm going to die, I keep finding myself asking myself ""Why should I care what she *might* think?"" Of course, I'll be playing hella video games, too, especially Overwatch, Dragon's Dogma, and Mass Effect (the first one). I'll also be on the lookout for something I can blow $1300 on. Then, around 1AM, I'll enjoy on last cool, bottled coke and commence my suicide plan. It's almost a shame that I'm dying since I haven't had confidence like this since sophomore year of high school. Nevertheless, this wild-ass ride is coming to an end.

&amp;nbsp;

I finished watching season 11 of IASIP the other day and [that ending credits theme they used](https://soundcloud.com/the-dixie-hummingbirds/jesus-will-answer-prayer) for the last episode of the season is really stuck in my head. As someone who hates God as much as I do, I can't deny good music when I hear it. That, juxtaposed with [this beat by Lil Ugly Mane](https://soundcloud.com/jenzilly/lil-ugly-mane-alone-and-suffering), captures the irony that haunts my present state of suffering.

&amp;nbsp;

The most pressing regrets on my mind are as follows:

I never lived to see version 1.0 of Dwarf
Fortress.

I never got to play Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord.

I did not live to play Mass Effect: Andromeda.

I also didn’t live to hear ""Black Ken"" or ""Secret Circle.""

&amp;nbsp;

There is this lovely English expression that I found that also really gets at the juice of my experience. For the past six-ish weeks, and honestly for the past three years, with suicidal thoughts being so constantly oppressing that I could hardly get out of bed, I've **""been living on borrowed time,""** and that time is finally ending.",suicide

My parents (I'm a junior in high school) are driving me home from my therapist, they are dropping me off and leaving for a meeting with friends. I was able to keep a very happy mood during the appointment, very excited for college and future, all that shit. It worked, I'm off the hook (sounds improbable, but I can be quite convincing) and we all decided I don't have to see her anymore. I really liked my therapist- so now there's a huge weight off my chest. Now I can kill myself and she won't get blamed for it. It's like I've been taking these steps, consciously, and subconsciously, to lessen the effect of my death. I can easily hang myself in the basement as soon as they leave. It takes a huge effort to smile and look at people in the eye, I have to drag myself to do everything. Nothing seems worthwhile or interesting anymore, I've lost five pounds in a week, I never feel proud from accomplishments, another thing I don't want to do takes it's place. My gpa is low. I could tell someone about it, but I don't want to get better. The guilt I always have (probably originates from not owing up to my potential) is substantially smaller when I push myself into a robotic unfeeling state. I hate myself. Over time, I'm just going to continue to burden everyone around me. I don't want to hurt my family, but maybe my death will be better for everyone in the long run. Friends around me seem so superficial when they smile or seem excited about something, I'm stuck here with no goals, no desire to be happy. I could fight for happiness, but why? I see no difference.

Edit: I also have this extreme all or nothing mentality. I usually don't eat for a day, then binge. How do people even moderate anything? Whatever I do, I have no restraint so it gets dangerous, self destructive, or out of control. I feel slightly superior to my peers, so everything I do has to be perfect, or I won't do anything at all and just self harm. I owe my parents so much, I could never fully repay them- they created me! so there's this guilt that tints everything I do. I'm always so empty, or feel disgusting, vulnerable. The only reason I haven't killed myself is for my family, but as my constant mood worsens, I can see my death would be more beneficial than drawn out dependence. I hate myself. I hate myself.

298697,"I have a serious dilemma. Roommate is spiraling out of control...Moved to Boston in January. I leave in August. My three roommates are total strangers and one of them, who has been in the same room for seven years, is showing signs of serious disorder.

He is a major alcoholic and takes Venlafaxine and Clonzepam. Last week I woke up to four policemen and a paramedic in my kitchen. Someone had called them in and they surrounded him, asking him how much he had to drink. He said ""just two shots"" in a very dilapidated manner. That night he stayed in a hospital and listed me as a contact.

Our apartment is disgusting. His room is covered in trash, clothes, power cords, empty whiskey bottles, and cigarette butts.

Then I find out that our rent is $8,000 in the hole. He is very difficult to talk to and the four of us hardly speak. So now I'm in communication with his brother and sister-in-law who are reluctantly going to help him pay the rent.

He doesn't work and doesn't go to school, he lies to his family about school and getting job interviews. I hear him screaming and vomiting and banging on the wall every night. He stumbles around, breaking things and making a mess.

He needs to go to rehab or something because this situation is only worsening.

I'm very scared to live with him and I don't know what to do. I am the only one who, when the situation arises, speaks to him in a helpful and friendly manner. But at the same time I am scared for my own safety.

Do any of you have ideas about what I can do to calm down or maybe reach out to him? Thankyou.",suicide

287237,"20(M). Here for a friend and i need advice cause I'm genuinely fucked i guess...Hey everyone...
I'm 20(M) and I'm here for some advice regarding a friend of mine.
Now a little context...
I decided to get a degree in animation and hence took admission in a college for the course. I met a lot of people. Good people, great people. And also a lotta not so good people. Its been 7 months and my life has turned upside down literally.
I met a girl and we immediately hit it off. We have the same interests and somewhat similar thoughts. Both of us have been through a lot and i was always willing to help her. She was a real good friend. Until she fell in *love* with me.
She had never experienced that before. Infact she was always Adamant that she'd never fall in love with anyone. And yet here i was.

She called me one night. She said she hadn't slept for four days because the thought of confession was killing her and she did confess...
I personally didn't have the same feelings for her. I still don't and i explained that to her. I explained to a degree that she calmed down.
Next day, she told me she had cut herself up. Not a simple cut. She started above her palm and cut till her bicep. She told me she lay in the pool of her blood for an entire night. Just crying. And it was because of me...
I feel like a fuckin monster. And i am still traumatized.  She used to cut herself before that. But nothing to this degree. There's still a huge scar on her hand.
I was fucked. I still am.

Later on, she started acting weirdly. Literally.
A few people *influenced* her against me.
Me talking to other girls became a Problem.
People have always talked behind my back, and suddenly, she started to believe all that Shit.
*Oh he's talking to that girl who's in our group. She's a bitch. He definitely loves her. He doesn't deserve you.* And she always used to burst that anger on me.
She later confessed that she was wrong and she shouldn't have believed that. But ofcourse this statement was a temporary phase.

She started targeting my friends. *Why do you go out with him everyday?*
*Why does he talk to that girl and not me?*
*Why doesn't he pay attention to her?*
*What does he see in her that he doesn't see in me?*
She's jealous of the girls i meet. She's jealous of the boys i go out with.

We had a college trip and we talked in like 3 degree temperature. She wanted a reason for rejection. And tbh, i never reject someone because of a *reason.* I told her that i just didn't feel the connection required for a relationship. And i explained this to her. I never left her through her phase.

She messaged me a few weeks ago.
Told me that she wants to change how she looks or how she sounds. Cause according to her, those things are more important. When i asked about the cuts she replied *I dont think I'll ever stop that.*
She justifies her behaviour by saying *I'm tired of being worried about you.* And it just fucked me up even more.
Recently (like 4 days ago) she targeted one of my closest friends and talked aggressively with her.

I even had a dream where i saw her jumping off of a cliff. When i consulted a friend he said, *considering her... This might actually happen.*
And he was right. If she does decide to commit suicide, I'll be blamed for everything.

I talk to her, she has a Problem. I don't, she has a problem. I help her, she has a problem, I don't help, she has a problem. I try to save her, nope. I don't try to, still nope. I've done everything in my power and I'm just too tired now. Not tired of her, but I'm at the last straw of my strength myself.
I never imagined myself getting caught in a situation like this. What did i do to deserve this i do not know.

The way she cut herself up still fucks me up everyday. I haven't felt so disgusted in my life and I've been through a lot myself. But thats not the point.

What should i do? I've decided to email a few suicide prevention sites. I'll explain the situation to them... Also, as i said, she doesn't accept help. So I can't *physically* take her to a therapist. She did take treatment from one... But she decided to stop.
Ironically, her sis is a soon to be psychologist.
She hasn't cut herself up recently as far as i know.  But her attitude and sadness and the approach towards life that she is taking is...

Please i need advice... ",suicide

I have depression, anxiety, and stress which cause me to have no motivation, and everyday I come home from my ""going nowhere"" job and lay in bed for hours staring at a wall.  Many times my staring matches with the wall result in me crying uncontrollably and feeling so alone.  I'm not alone though, got a girlfriend.  We've had a rough year or so and it's going down the shitter.  I actually spit in her face today in a fit of rage.  I've advised her many times that she should go meet a real man who can actually satisfy and make her happy.

308396,"Feel Suicidal Because of Sexual Preference and The Planet

To introduce myself. I'm male, I have no family or friends.

And just to note, I've never abused a child. I would never abuse a child. My issue comes with my sexual preferences, which is pedophilia. I was exposed to child nudity from a young age, as most do. And had witnessed abuse once or twice. From what I can tell, this caused my attraction to children. I've been to therapy for this because, I value other lives over my own. I don't want to bring harm to anyone. What this made me realize was how others are not helped at all, let alone made aware of it. With all this stuff coming out on the internet about people supposedly being involved with rape and grooming, it makes me wonder, how can we prevent this from happening? There's a lot of focus on imprisoning people, and even the death penalty/torture to these people (which is a human rights violation). But not enough about preventing, about not committing these immoral acts.

When I realize that there's many other issues with myself and the world, it makes me begin to feel hopeless. Because nobody wants to change. Nobody wants to look past that stigma behind these issues. They don't look at it from the other point of view. Part of why I hate my life is because of my autism. It has caused more suffering in my life than anything else. This combined with my sexual preferences. It's created this hole that I can't climb out of. I have these sexual thoughts, and they are my only way of coping with it. There's no way to get rid of pedophilia.

I've done all the research I could on it, and nothing comes all. All people want to do is castrate those who have it. Or enact the death penalty. As far as I know, this gives more reasons for someone to act on their sexual urges. Especially those who have already done it once. And it doesn't solve the core issue, which will no doubt come up regardless of the percentage of cases of X.

my motivator for wanting to die is the suffering that happens all across the world. To all sentient life. It saddens me to see violence used against anyone, for any reason. I wonder if there is ever hope out there. To see change in the world. Whether it's our attitudes to certain topics, or the way we treat each other. So much injustice happens, and yet, I find myself wanting to die before anyone else.

Why cant I feel something? I feel empty, anxious, my mind chaotic but my spirit-nothing except fear. I have a boyfriend-my first in 22 years, and I like him a lot he is the sweetest person and I really dont deserve his kindness, but I honestly dont see my appeal, and I HATE that I dont feel giddy about our relationship. I know I like him, but I don't FEEL it. Thats not saying much cause I dont feel much of anything, except fear and sometimes broody anger. I am trying though, trying to be a good girlfriend to him, a good friend to my friends, a good daughter for my parents, a good sister for my younger siblings, a good student and responsible person. I just wish I could figure out how I feel so I could make a decision on what I want in life. I feel like I am just going with the flow so I dont get behind in life or become suicidal again, relying on suicidal fantasies and SI to calm and comfort me. I am trying to do the best thing, but instead I feel like I am just building a straw house  that is gonna collapse under its own weight soon enough, hurting people in the process and making my own life an irreparable mess. But I cant shut these people out, I can't give up because of my f***ed-up head. I just dont know if I am making the right decisions here. I have no idea what to do. I dont want to ask for advice because I am afraid I will get the wrong advice again and make another bad decision like I did with school when I wanted to change my major but everyone said I shouldnt, that it was just my emotions getting the better of me. I now know I should have changed it. I feel stuck. I am sick and tired of feeling stuck. I want to feel good about life. ",suicide

12463,"Wish I could tell themThey're both on reddit, so I decided to create a throwaway account.

This post is to sort of...Give them a break. They've been through a lot already with me, and I'm feeling so guilty about opening up about myself every day. I feel selfish, irritating, repetitive...I keep saying the same things, how I hate my body and face, how I don't believe I've got any talents, how my personality isn't desirable...
They keep reminding me occasionally how they feel about me, but I regretfully feel like it's all lies. How could you love this?

I keep making it worse. I thought this was just another ""phase"" of mine, but it's not going away. I keep telling them ""Yeah, I should be better after a couple of days!"" But now every day is a struggle with me. Waking up is really hard. I have a constant need to put myself down. I've managed to hide a part of it, but on some days I just need to be painfully obvious about it all.

I don't know how long until they're both gone. They'll find better, they've already found it...probably, I'm just assuming as usual. This constant need of validation feels really awful. I feel toxic.

Hey, I hope you both get what you want from life. The friends and the girlfriends you keep talking about, not the baggage like I am. You'll meet talented, beautiful people, you can forget me and that's the day when the sun shines brighter. You'll be loved by many more, because that's what you deserve.

51344,"Maybe it's destinySome people are destined for greatness, others for meekness. But I am destined for death by my own hand. Why else do I feel nothing but discontent?  My entire life has been filled with events, thoughts, and feelings inexorably pushing me towards suicide. It seems not that I reject life or that I flee from it, but that, I am incompatible with it.

I graduated college some months ago. Dean's list all four years, magna cum laude. I felt nothing. The day I was supposed to walk I hid under my blankets and cried. I wasn't sad to leave my friends behind. I wasn't anxious about my future, my career prospects.  While my friends threw parties and reminisced and made tearful Facebook posts about their experience and their futures, there was nothing in me but emptiness. That's why I cried. I looked back on my life, my many accomplishments, and realized that I was fundamentally broken. A human must feel something, anything, but I felt nothing. I feel nothing.

There is nothing in me but discontent. It isn't just that I feel nothing, but that I *am* nothing. My personality isn't real. My emotions aren't real. I am not a real person. I am more an automaton meant to imitate human life. Wanting nothing, feeling nothing, built only to do as expected.  I always wondered why I would be born into a human body while whatever internality I possessed lacked all human qualities.   But, I know now. I was born to kill myself. I was born to suffer in nothingness and discontent and then to die, unexpectedly, by my own hand.

I've always prided myself on believing only what I can prove through evidence. I don't know why this strange spirituality has come upon me -- just as all my preparations were completed this past week. All I know is that I'm convinced. Life is not for me. It was never really meant for me. This is my fate. I accept it.",suicide

101063,"Just leaving this hereSo, I'm just honestly going to say it; I straight up want to die. I don't see why I am even alive anymore, except that I just can't do it. I can't do it to them, I can't do it to my boyfriend, not to my mom, not my dad, not my animals. I could do it to myself, but I can't do that to them.
I don't see the point of doing this day in, day out anymore. I don't feel good, I am in constant pain; mentally and physically. They won't give me medication because I am underage, and they won't prescribe me the right medication when they do want to help me because I am overweight due to all of the other problems I have with my body.

I honestly feel like I am already dead, I'm just still inside of my body. I just need to vent, this is never going to end. I will always be in pain, I will never be a normal person and I will most likely be wheelchair/bed bound forever. The only thing I can do to prevent myself the pain and exhaustion is sleep. And true, it helps. Because those are the only moments that I am not in pain; or at least those are the moments I don't feel it. I wish my Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome would just decide to rupture an organ and have me bleed to death, at least people wouldn't know that I wished for it, would talk about me dying because of my disease, not because of suicide.

I was doing okay for over a year and then my Father-in-Law (I don't know how else to describe him except for... Asshole) decided it was a good idea to tell me, when I was talking about my pants not fitting properly, that the only sollution was to kill myself.

And I've been this incredible mess since, it's been over a month and I can't get over it. I want to hurt myself but I know I would be sent off to a psychiatric hospital, because I tried to do this before. I tried to end it before; it's been a year, he knew and decided to make that comment and it's broken me into a million little pieces. And it's only confirmed what I already thought; that I will never be their family, even if I have been together with my boyfriend for over 4 years. I am not their family, and I never will be.

The only one who said anything to the Asshole was my boyfriend.

It's all the pain, the mental and the physical pain is sucking me into it's hole again and now I realize that it's only going to return worse each time that it appears it's getting better.

I'm sorry for leaving such a long post, needed to get it off of my chest. I doubt it's going to help. But I need to try.",suicide
343249,"My mother found my vibe and is screaming at me for not talking about it I can't deal with this anymore. I bought an adult toy recently because my libido is quite high for a teenager and because I'm really stressed because of my mother. She gets angry at the stupidest things possible at me and dad. Today she was acting kinda mean and I didn't understand why. When I was at the mall, she changed my sheets even though she knows how much I hate when she enters my room without permission for anything  (I'm scared of her finding things that she wouldn't like and screaming at me), and found my vibrator. She called me and told me about it in a nit picking way, and kept asking me weird stuff about it. I told her that I'm super uncomfortable and stressed talking about this, and she said that we'll talk home. I told her I don't wanna talk at all about this with her, and she got super pissed, saying that ""I'm your mother and I deserve to know because I do so many things for you "", and ""you're obligated to tell me about this"". I burst out in tears at the mall telling her that I don't wanna do this, and she kept asking ""why are you crying now? I didn't even shout at you"". I ended the call, and she later called me and started the conversation by saying  ""did you finish already""? (Here we have a word which is super mean to say to a child) which made me burst into tears even more. I texted her saying that I did not like what she said, and she said sorry numerous times.
      When I got home:
I went to my bedroom waiting in fear of dad coming in my room wanting to talk about it or my mom coming home from gym.  When mom came they both came in my room and started interrogating me about it. Now, my dad is pretty chill,  unlike my mother, but I wasn't prepared for the conversation so I told them numerous times that I don't wanna talk about it. None of them understood and kept trying to ask, so i raised my voice to leave me alone and my mother started shouting that ""you're obligated to tell me"" ""I'm your mother "" so many times and I told both of them to get out of my room. Dad kept trying to pamper me but I was annoyed at the both of them, so I kept repeating that i want them out of my room. They finally left after I started crying, with mom rolling her eyes, and I told them that I didn't wanna see any of them today, but my mother kept trying to find a reason to talk to me.

Why am I obligated  to do this? Is this normal? I don't wanna talk at all about this! I feel ashamed of myself and disgusted with her behaviour. Do I have to tell her about it? They're expecting that I'll tell them tomorrow.  Tomorrow I'm going on a trip with my cousin.  I don't wanna talk to anyone about this f2f or phone call.

287103,"Why this 16 year old want to kill herselfMultiple reasons, but I'll start somewhere. One is that I’ve failed 6/10 GCSEs by certainty because I didn’t go (I don’t want to talk about why) and on Results Day my life and future is going to be shattered with a hammer. I am ashamed of myself beyond words, and there isn’t another option for me next year, other than my school’s Sixth Form. At least not one that involves education anyway (I’ve said that to a few teachers but they’ve never got what I was implying).
I was one of the super smart kids. I am the biggest disappointment of my Year grades-wise; highest benchmarks (six benchmark 8s) to lowest GCSEs (failing MOST). I NEVER revised ONCE in all the years. I’ve wasted my education and wasted everyone’s time. I’m BEYOND what you call a disgrace. There is no college that will have me and I can’t go to college. I struggle to make friends as it is. There’s no way, college is all wrong for me. My sister is going to be getting good GCSEs. She’s passed them all and is expecting a few 9s (A**). I’m the biggest disappointment everyone knows. I’ve let down everyone I know; my family, my teachers, my peers and everyone else. There is no happiness for me if I don’t get into Sixth Form. You need 5 passes and I can get 4 at the max. I’ve thrown away my shot. Especially as I’m very naturally intelligent, it’s so embarrassing that I’ll probably be getting a 2 or 3 in English. My sister is expecting a 9. I don’t know how I’m going to react on Results Day when I open that envelope and my world comes crashing down. I will probably be in shock. I’ve ruined my future. What is there for someone who gets, say, 2 GCSEs. It’s 2019.

I also believe, especially as, as far as I know, my school’s never had a suicide, if anyone should kill themselves (not that anyone should), it should be me. It would have the biggest effect if it was me. I was very severely bullied every day for 4 years by 13 people, and about 6 at once. The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme. The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it. I was the most hated person in the year, maybe even the school, for NO REASON. Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity. I have been depressed for about the last 2 years. And I have very very few friends and no social life at all. Having few friends slowly erodes your self-esteem, not that I had much left after being bullied and being the laughing stock of the Year. I never did ANYTHING to the people who bullied me. I just burst into tears writing this. I didn’t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for 4 years 😭😭💔💔.

If I killed myself, all those kids would think “She really did it” and would say “WE drove her to this” and kids at neighbouring schools would say “You know (my name) who got picked on? She committed suicide” and “A girl from (my school) killed herself!” And “Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd, thinking “Oh it’s (my name) so it’s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and tell her to KILL HERSELF” and now she’s dead.”

No one really cares about me. Or maybe they all care, just not enough.

Also if I kill myself before too long after I’ve left Year 11, the school will sort of take responsibility and will put up a memorial (I should hope) and try to remember me and do memorial assemblies, etc. I do have bonds with some legend teachers though so that would be sad. I just hope to god for my own HAPPINESS/LIFE they give me a  Sixth Form place without the required grades because of ‘exceptional circumstances’. I went to Sixth Form Induction Day and I LOVE it. That day was an amazing day. It’s something positive to look forward to - I’m so excited about it but it might not get to happen. If I’m going to end my own life at some point in my life, it should be in high school because they are the people who started the chain of events that will ruin my life (although the bullies should know they have done that already to me). If I do it as an adult, they probably wouldn’t even know or would remember me as merely “someone from school” so it wouldn’t have a good effect. However, if I did it while in school, all the people who hated/bullied/laughed at/teased me are in one place and you never know maybe they’ll actually care about me or feel sorry for what they did when they know I ended my life. Also if I do it in college or something (if I have to go there, god forbid), school wouldn’t make a big deal out of it. I’ve just realised this sounds like I want to do it for attention but that’s not it at all, it just sounds like that because I’m writing about what they would do if I was gone which is what I sometimes think about.

Also, I have caused 2 people I live with health problems. I gave my mum chronic fatigue, which meant she was out of work for 6 years, by being an incredibly stressful MONSTER of a young child, and my sister has anxiety which she 100% blames on me. I am no good for anyone. I wish my mum didn’t have twins and just had my twin sister and not me. I feel very sorry for them that they have to live with me. My mum called me “the most difficult child in the world to live with” and calls me disgusting so much I should start a tally. My twin sister said she is DISGUSTED, EMBARRASSED, HORRIFIED and ASHAMED to be related to me. I don’t deserve anything.

I’m a waste of oxygen.

69502,"im not sure theres much reason left for me to continue livingI wish i has some wise sage words in my head that make me want to stay alive, but alas i do not

I've been thinking about this alot recently, i'm been on estrogen 9 months, strongly thinking about how SRS and some of the other things i want are seriously out of reach because of cost, and inability to afford the time off from work for it, I've cried over it alot recently, being transgender is not a walk in the park, especially being MtF

the only reason i'm still breathing right now are the hormones and the fact i don't want my passing to hurt any of the people i deeply care about...i don't like being toxic but i feel as though becoming toxic, removing myself from their lives, distancing myself from my sister, distancing myself from society. I love my friends, and the person who has let me into their life romantically...but i continue to struggle to see a reason to continue to live, to wake up in the morning, go to to my dead-end job, eat, make time for friends.

To be brutally honest, the hormones are probably whats keeping me going at this point as i do finally feel like i belong in this body now, that i deserve to have friends, a loving partner.  They give me a reason to keep getting out of bed, going to work, living.

Sadly i don't think they will continue to work that way for much longer, nothing ever does.  I've felt this way since I was 10, when my mom died, the voice saying do it keeps getting louder and i think the time for me is about up, the voices telling me i don't deserve to live are going to consume me before 40. I have a strong sneaking suspision when my cat dies, i will be going soon afterwards, he has been my rock through multiple relationships, and he's been here for the begining of my transition, but he's 10, he's probably got another 5 or so years left

My plan now is to save enough money to go back to Milwaukee, back to the place i was born, buy a plot of land in the cemetery near where my parents are buried, and then jump into Lake Michigan, with a note explaining everything in case my body ever surfaces

I'd hate to hurt my sister, my person, my friends, but they are stronger, they will survive me passing, my ex-wife saved me at 30, gave me the strength to accept who and what i was, there isn't anyone left who can save me now, i can't see a future with me in it, either as a man, or as a woman and it hurts so much",suicide

My future ones as well?
Im not a good person, I never believed so, but am I really that horrible? Is anxiety my ""toxic behaviour"" or is it myself?

Im so worried about fucking things ups again. I cant even go to certain places or even hear certain songs because Im thrown into a fit of panic because they remind me of my old friends. I really, really dont want to keep on living like that.

last night i sobbed on the phone for i’m not sure how long. but it felt like a long time. and my boyfriend couldn’t do anything, he didn’t feel anything. and i don’t think he feels anything right now. idk how much longer i can do this, where i don’t feel loved or appreciated.

he hasn’t put in much effort lately. it honestly feels like i’m carrying this relationship on my back and it’s exhausting because school is already taking so much out of me, i can’t be the perfect girlfriend. i tried. even me trying isn’t appreciated. nothing i do is appreciated anymore. he expected me to show him my body on call when i can’t even look at myself in the mirror anymore. i suppressed emotions because it felt like if i didn’t he would blow up at me and tell me he doesn’t love me again. and i can’t go through another time of my bf telling me he doesn’t love me anymore. the emotional toll of that experience has proven true because i wonder every single waking moment if he still loves me. and i really shouldn’t have to do that. his words are starting to hold much less weight over time because i don’t know if he means it. and now my words aren’t holding weight anymore because I’d tell him that i’m okay when i really wasn’t. i wanted to ease tension by putting aside my own feelings and just bottling them up. i never wanted to talk about them.

he’s angry with me. and i’m angry at him for not showing any effort or sweetness. he’s angry at me for me getting angry. this is so exhausting. it feels like he’s taking me for granted or purposely pushing me away. it feels like he doesn’t appreciate me being around anymore. i don’t know how much more of this i can take. i just wanna stop existing. everything is so painful.

earlier he told me “i hope you weren’t lying about your exes”. my exes have been toxic. one of them would only be happy if i sent nudes. another would compare me to girls all the time and gaslight me whenever i got upset about it. another one wouldn’t show any emotion other than annoyance or disgust with me. they’ve all caused me to hate myself more and more. one after the other, my self hatred grows. partly because i let myself take this treatment and partly because i kept being told i wasn’t good enough. over and over again. and i have the same feeling of me not being good enough.

i don’t feel beautiful. i don’t feel valued. i don’t feel appreciated. i don’t feel loved. i don’t feel happy.

i don’t have enough friends to distract myself. i’ve dedicated myself to the same person for the past 5 months and now i don’t know if it was worth anything. mostly because i don’t know if he’s willing to put in effort anymore. mostly because i think he knows he can find another girl very easily and discard me like the others. i’ve sacrificed so much for one person, and my mom was right about how we get hurt when we put too much effort into one person. my mom was right when she said women are stupid when they’re in love.

i’m getting back to that dark place in my life where i had no appetite. i’d weigh myself morning and day and make sure i only lose weight. i’m getting back to the point where i cry every night wondering if i’m worth anything to anyone and wondering if i disappeared if anything would change. i know at this point people would only benefit from my lack of existence. everyone in my life could stand a lot less me being around. i don’t know what to do about this because if i talk to my boyfriend about this then he’d tell me i’m dumping my feelings onto him. i can’t talk to my therapist half the time because our sessions are only 50 minutes and outside those sessions he takes a long time to respond. my parents aren’t emotionally capable enough to empathize with me and help me get through this. i don’t want to talk to this about my friends because it’s not their problem. i have no one right now.

When i signed in, i faked my name, address and my whole identity. (I know its illegal stop please) because i knew i had to fly in a few days, i knew they would keep me there more time then i had. I ended up climbing out of my window and running home. It feels unreal, and numbing. I kind of feel like i dont even remember it all properly, im not quite sure why. I just have strong feelings come up whenever i think about the day.

About three years ago I experienced the most excruciating months of my life.. during it one of my best friends killed herself (she was found after months of being missing, under the ice, drowned.) and another close friend died in a traffic accident. I cant really explain, it felt so fucking fucked up and everyone pretty much broke apart. Everything I knew from that town died off and it just freaking sucked. I really miss the both of them so so much, I swear. I've never had such a strong emotion or desire towards anything. I love them so much and i still do. sometimes it feels like I don't even remember what they look like anymore, and in general this past seems so fake and unreal. If there is an afterlife, I hope they're okay now. :/

During these past few years, I really have developed depression and anxiety. and I self harm way too much to deal with them, to the point that i need to apply fake skin (which is used for halloween) on my hands to cover those fucking shred marks. Now, since then, I have moved to a different country. In this new school i am in, everything is significantly more pressuring.. everyone I know are so fucking fake, and their prime purpose of life is getting into Stanford.
I have friends here, and asking anyone, i guess i could seem like one of those people with loads of friends and in general highly liked in this place, but its really not like this. I have fun with my friends now and then i guess, but i know they don't give a shit about me. I told about my past and my current diagnosis to a few of them, and they really brushed it off, to a point where a month later I tried to talk to them about it again.. they had totally forgotten what I had told them. All they want to talk about is always how their boyfriend problems are soooo important and all that fucking bullshit.

Last may, I contacted one of my teachers asking them for an ear. He is the first adult who I've actually ever had a conversation like this before.. and every time i ever try to talk to someone about my shitty ass past or feelings, i cry like a bitch throughout the day/week. its fucking humiliating. back to the story. He really was the most lovely empathetic teacher I have ever met. I ended up kind of telling this typical rap to him, (my past, and what i feel like at the moment, except i never told him about my self harm).  He ended up inviting me over to his house to get to know his wife since she had similar experiences. Instead of talking about all the disgusting feelings stuff, we talked about everyday things.. music (which he has amazing taste on) and it was just really nice having a proper conversation with someone normally. Since then, he's acting different towards me, every time he sees me he has this sour face as if I'm some kind of time consuming freak. the problem is.. I've developed a huge crush on him, i fucking hate it, every time i see him i cant breathe, i panic i get so sad.. (I have frequent panic attacks every day for no reason anyway) and it hurts me so much how much he ignores me. i go out of my way to take a route in school where he is most likely to be all the time. I know his timetable. He is all i think about now.

I've become really suicidal and to the point that i feel like no human being actually gives a shit about anything or anyone. in the end, we are all selfish motherfuckers who only go for our own benefit. the whole world is based on getting money from you and convincing everyone on how happy we are.

I don't really know what part i want advice on. I just need some feedback. anything.

229145,"Remembering my mom singing “You are my Sunshine” moves me to tears and it’s the only thing that keeps me calm.She used to sing it to me all the time when I was little. It was my lullaby. I’m only 14 but I feel that all the good times are gone. My dad says we can make new memories together as a family but it just isn’t the same. I asked my mom to sing it to me and she did but it just didn’t sound like that soothing voice I remember.

I cried tonight. I’m crying now. I thought that I forgot how the cry. I can’t resist it. Looking through all my old toys, old memories, I’ll never have those times back. I remember going to the park with my dad in kindergarten, playing in the autumn. I try to recreate the memories but it isn’t the same.

This one lyric of that song breaks me:

“Please don’t take my sunshine away.”

I want to die so badly, but I’m her sunshine. I can’t leave but this life is so stressful. I don’t understand. I feel like I’m falling. That lyric is telling me to stay. She’s telling me to stay. But I just can’t handle it. I can’t. I’m scared i’m scared i’m scared I’m scared I’m scared.  The good times are gone and I want to go so badly but that song. That damn song. That damn lyric.

119592,"Autistic and want to get out asap..Posted the same thing on r/aspergers as this is relevant to the main reason I want to off myself at least in 2020. Posting it here too to get some viewpoints from people with a wider variety of experiences with crappy lives.



Asperger's is a fucking curse and I wish my dad were shot in the balls as a kid so I'd not be here right now. Now that I have this out of the way, let me give you the two reasons why life as an autistic is so pointless.

1. No freaking chance of a fulfilling career. Why the hell am I attending university if all I'm gonna be is stuck at the lowest possible placement forever. I'm not going to ask my boss for a raise or a promotion or to any sort of teamwork with my colleagues. Of course, that is if I ever even get a job, because practically all of them want me to be a 'team player' with 'superb social skills'. Yeah fuck that. I'm not going to be a janitor with a PhD in a STEM field, rather be jobless.
2. Never going to have someone to call my own. I'd like to kick the asses of all NTs who think aspies are soulless and emotionless. I'm at the age where a mate is practically a necessity. Well good luck with that. I can't do anything about my social skills and society will maybe start accepting autistics long after I'm gone or wouldn't care anymore.

So basically, a fulfilling life. Two main things everybody else can have in their lives. I have no hope. Any therapist or a loved one would tell you it will get better yadda yadda. True in most cases, not for autistics. I know exactly what awaits me tomorrow or the next decade for that matter. Pain and more pain and disappointment. For me and I guess many like me, the chances of something actually getting better are close to a religious miracle. As in, there is no point in hoping. How many autistics have died alone in misery for every Einstein in the world? Not planning for 50 more years of pure mental torture for an infinitesimally tiny possibility for a somewhat normal life.

Since then they've been scattered throughout my life, I've ended up in hospital multiple times after attempts, and had overdoses as common as weekends.

It sounds like such a stupid reason, but the human touch/connection is so important, like there's billions of people in the world you could get a hug and conversation from anyone, but I feel so isolated.

208500,"The first year of my new lifeProbably should have made a throwaway for this but screw it, I'm all about being an open-book so here goes;

So it's been a year since I escaped my hometown. A dreadfully boring, imprisoning place. You know the kind, not small enough to be quaint, not big enough to be engaging. There's the running joke that nobody really leaves, some just get away for a short while. I promised myself If I ever got out I'd live the life I want, that everything would be **better**.
I tried to make due. A couple of years ago I decided to improve my situation the best I could - how I could -  instead of wallowing in it.
It worked! I started therapy, exercising, quit the job I hated, I was content most of the time. Still pretty hopeless, but given my situation and that place, it was to be expected.

Then randomly a friend propositioned me for a road trip, go visit his brother up north. I had recently ended a seasonal job and had a small savings built up and although normally I would say no, for all of the same small reasons I always did, I remembered my ""Yes Man"" mantra and figured why not? Better than being in my room all day until I found some other crappy job that cemented me in poverty again.

Surprisingly everything went my way! I found a shitty job, bought a shitty vehicle and stayed with them for awhile. Then I lucked my way into my current job. I went from food stamps and Obamacare to Lower Middle Class. Suddenly a two-week trip with a couple of changes of clothes turned into a permanent move.

I got out of my comfort zone, tried dating for the first time ever. Although nothing really ever came of it, I realized I could kinda human like everybody else! Then by happenstance I met someone and for a little while it felt like what I saw others had. I was happy and could actually imagine a future for myself.

Of course in reality, it was an awful situation to get into and ended poorly (A few terrifying posts about it are in my comment history for those interested enough to laugh at my insecurity and naivete) but I've found my peace with it and am able to look back at the experience and appreciate the happy memories and how it made me grow as a person.

So *here I am*. A year in my new home. I got what I always wanted - **Freedom**. From poverty, my family, that black hole of a town. Yet I can't escape myself. Sure, I've gotten much better at pretending to be human but I'm still a watcher at heart. I still get depressed regularly, I'd still rather be dead. At least now that I live alone I can cry and pass out drunk on the livingroom floor instead of holed away in my room, trying to be as quiet as possible so my family wouldn't hear.

I forced myself to go to the bar last night, thought I should celebrate my anniversary. Took me three hours to work up the nerve to leave my apartment and face the crowd. I'd be lying if the  decent possibility of running into my ""ex"" and her new beau didn't start the anxiety hamster-wheel spinning. Even though I honestly just hope she's finally happy and in a stable place. Still, even just the potential of THAT awkward small talk is paralyzing.

I went though. Place was packed. Opened my tab, grabbed my drink and took a seat in the middle of the whole mess. Force myself to be where I'm most uncomfortable. Can't teach an old dog new tricks though, didn't talk to a single person the whole night. Just sat with my beer and watched, listened. Like I always do. The happy faces, finally free on a Saturday night. The ones who've had a little too much. The pick-up artists moving from one rejection to another. Oh yes all of the signs were there. *Leaned-in whispers and the accidental touches.* Hell I even got a few furtive glances and half-smiles; An invitation I'd never accept.

Of course I understand the irony of it - to chuckle and think myself better than the damn game, even though I just don't have the balls to play it.
12:30 hits and I decide I've had enough. Figure this counts as at least an instance of ""socializing"" for the weekend and I'm at least smart enough to leave before the cops start to cruise the block.

That's it. My year is up and I'm still the watcher I've always been. Only now I have no more excuses. Though now I just accept who I am. I don't see myself as a failure for being alone. It's just who I always was, who I will be I suppose. It's not a bad life *per se*, but damn if there was just a point to it. It's not even sadness anymore - I mean I understand when the depression kicks in that my thoughts are being hijacked into thinking I'm sad - but when I'm ""normal"" It's just apathy. I think of the future and I don't see it. There's no daydream, just black emptiness. I know I'll end it someday, when I run out of excuses. When I'm too tired and I need to rest. Goddamn it, I feel so fucking tired **now**. Don't worry Redditors, it won't be today. I told myself I'd get out and see Civil War. Was supposed to go to the 10 o'clock showing and I'm about 5 hours late but I told myself I'd leave this apartment and I'll make myself do it at some point.

So I sit here in front of my keyboard, hiding for now. Maybe this was the wrong sub to post my shitty writing but screw it.  I've got my cold beer and if you've got yours let's metaphorically clink glasses. Here's to another year. Cheers.

Life isn't what I planned, it's not bad, but it is depressingly lonely. Knowing I'll be that ""old"" it causing a lot of emotions...I feel like i've wasted my youth and I've lost the chance to have meaningful friendships in my life.


I should feel positive. I have a fantastic job, I'm the youngest teacher at a local college, I teach a subject that interests me and I get paid to talk about it. That should be enough, but no. I still feel like I have zero idea what I want from life, I kind of just fell into this job...I don't think I deserve it. Majority of my coworkers are the same age as my mom, so it's awkward to be social with them.


Maybe this is heightened because a friend of the family just OD'd two days ago and the thought of death is rapidly in my brain?


I used to go to dance and gymanstics everyday, I miss it. i miss my healthy body from it. Everyone else just seemed to make friends so easily while I was always on the sideline. I miss dance. I wish I had made friends as easily as everyone else did.

I call my grandpa &amp; grandma at least once a day, gives me someone to talk to. I don't bother with my mom, she loves me but she rarely has the time for me. I try calling her but she doesn't usually answer, she has her own life so that's fair enough. I'm not close with my sister, it's hard to be when I'm 27 and she just turned 13...I can only really talk to her on a superficial level. I have a boyfriend and he is amazing but I still feel incredibly lonely. I think they feel sad for me, they know that I'm lonely and I think they realize that I actually don't have friends. I had a friend, but we were both honestly toxic for each other so we don't talk anymore...probably for the best but I still miss our friendship.


I asked myself to think of reasons not to kill myself. I'm not skinny enough to die. I have my pet skinny pig and even though he rarely shows any love he'd starve without me. My family would be a wreck, it wouldn't be fair to them. I don't live alone and with social distancing it would be a lot of effort. I'm scared of what is on the other side. Because you can't listen to Hamilton or watch Bojack if you are dead. You can't start dancing again if you are dead. You can't write if you are dead. You can not video chat your loving niece if you are dead. You have no legacy if you die now. You've never seen Star Wars Land at Disneyland yet. Your mom would never forgive you. you won't get to cook again. You won't get to perform again.


Breathe. Take a breathe. I can't cry because I'm actually on video as I write all this down, my class is doing some assignments and little do they realize I am writing about why i shouldn't kill myself but want to.
I keep saying things will be okay, I keep trying to make things okay, I keep trying to add new lights into my life...but when will everything just be okay? stop. stop focusing on the negative. breathe. in. out. in. out.


now I need to go back to teaching my class, pretend none of these feelings are here. but the important thing is, I am safe, as much as i want to harm myself i know that writing this helped. I feel less anxious, I feel like I can focus on those reasons to not kill myself. It's a start.",suicide

Basically, lately she's been pretty sad and anxious for unknown reason, she says she's overthinking things a lot and overall she's pretty nervous, plus the pandemic and school are making it worse for her.

I have the feeling it's probably because she's kinda scared to be in a relationship with me, even if we just talk online, and even if i'm okay with that, i would not like her to be anxious because of it, because she could be thinking i may not be interested in her if she acts in some way or another.

The only thing I look forward to is that things will get better and they never do. It's exhausting to live. To eat. To breathe. There's no point to any of it. No meaning. I'm not important. I'm just a burden. It's  like I'm mentally challenged; everything that's so simple and easy for others take my greatest efforts.

Recently, I’ve found myself writing my suicide notes for a few people I care about. However, there’s this one note that I’m struggling to write. It’s for my old best friend, who I called my brother. We had platonic love. That bro love. A few years ago tho, he moved across country because his parents were dealing with divorce and his mom had moved him and his siblings out there. I was already dealing with depression and this hit hard because I wasn’t going to see the homie anymore. We were both dealing with a lot and my depression and suicidal tendencies really took a toll on him and he started pushing me away because I was bad for his health. I didn’t understand his choice until recently and it made me upset. Upset because I loved dude and upset because I knew everything had fallen apart because of me. He found new friends and I struggled and still struggle finding new ones. He stopped talking to me eventually and still doesn’t talk to me till this day no matter how many times I text him, hoping he’s okay and reminding I still care for him. Anyways, I’m here because I’m currently writing my notes and man it’s just so hard to try and write one for him. I have so much to say but I don’t know if he’d even care for one. It’s hard for me to believe that he’d want my negative energy back in his life one last time. But I also don’t want to make him sad with a note full of emotions and ‘I love you’’s.

Of course I do as well but not at the cost of staying here. Which is killing me. So after one day of feeling strong and ready to take on the world, I'm back at the rock bottom dreaming of going to sleep and never waking up again. Now... i'm afraid to tell my husband I feel like this again because he'll just promise me the moon and take it away. OR try and get me medications. I would rather die feeling passionate about dying then live through life feeling like I want to die or feeling like a zombie.

I've got to get my last affairs in order though. I want to try and die so it looks like an accident. That way my husband could collect life insurance and maybe actually move out. I don't want to suffer though and the only way I can think of is to ""fall off"" something.

1837,"I don't know how to carry on right nowIm 29, living in the UK.

A small background of my health conditions, just to give some context:
- bipolar disorder type 2
- severe anxiety
- obsessive compulsive disorder (which I'll explain a little)
- emotionally unstable personality disorder
- hyper mobility syndrome
- ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)

My diagnoses mean that I really don't and cannot function normally. I did for so long, forcing everything into a bulging box, taping it shut and hiding it under the bed.

Then I got made redundant from a job that I enjoyed and was good at. Very good at. It was a call centre admittedly, but I really enjoyed it. I made some brilliant friends, including someone that ended up being my best man and I really do consider him a very good friend. Through him, I have met other friends, plus someone who understands the shit that I am going through.

I ended up having to take a job that sucked. A lot. It was the beginning of the opening of that box. It was slowly being pulled out from under the bed. I was treated like shit. I had no sick pay, so when I needed the time off when I was having a bad MH day, I was financially fucked. I was working full time, looking after my wife and we struggled a lot. Not as bad as some, but my god it was hard. The job was complicated and my MH (which we later worked out was my ADHD) just compounded matters greatly.

I ended up getting another job! HUZZAH! It was in insurance which is something that I had done at my old job. Private office. Nice little family run business. Annnnnnnnnnnd that's where we hit the snag. I wasn't very good. I wasn't expecting myself to hit the floor running, but I hit the floor. Hard.

I wasn't worried though, I thought that I would be at least given training. Which I really wasn't. In anyway. But, I soldiered on for four days, getting up a lot earlier than I normally would have, mental health be damned. The pay was so much better, no shift work and I could get a bus all the way home, meaning that no busy town, no social interactions, just iPod and a quiet journey home.

Then, four days in, the recruitment agency that contacted me initially called. I was on the bus, leaving town as I had to collect a parcel from one of those amazon thingies, as I live in a flat and my wife's mobility isn't great, and this was a iPhone, so I wanted a secure place for it to go. I updated my facebook status ""New job, new me, new beginnings. Let's do this and let's get life back to what it should be! - feeling positive.""

I got on the bus and my phone rang. It was the recruiter and they had some concerns about my working there. The owner wasn't happy that I was asking questions and that I wasn't as good as they expected. Don't bother going back. My heart stopped, and I just didn't know what to do. I started to cry, but realised as a grown man, I had to hold it together on the bus. I started to catastrophise, terrified I was going to lose my house, my bills weren't going to get paid etc etc. Then there was my wife?! What was I supposed to do?

I got home and tried to be pragmatic, I applied for disability, I couldn't cope with the prospect of looking for a job in anyway as I knew the box had been ripped open and all manners of hell had been unleashed. Pandora had walked off with the proverbial butterfly that signified hope. She had walked off, crushing it in her palm.

Disability came through and I was ok for a little bit, I ended up in hospital after an attempt, but I was getting better, day by day. I applied for college, am doing ok ish on my course.

I subsequently got diagnosed with ADHD, and HMS shortly after, and I am struggling, but I am finding that some days I am falling under the water and cannot cope. I am inflicting a lot of this on my wife, being verbally abusive and quite frankly a total c*nt.

I have been physically abusive to her in the past which I am in NO WAY proud of. If I had my way before, I would not be posting this and someone would have been scraping my remains off the ground floor of a 18 story drop.

This brings us to now. (sorry if it seems a little patchy, I just wanted to give a little context). My OCD is at the point where I cannot stand waking up, I struggle with even little things not working, just the slightest imperfection in something and it must be rectified there and then. It also has left me having to constantly check that I have everything. Many times. It leads to me being late for things and panicking like a bitch when I cannot find something. My memory tends to feed the compulsions. I skin pick, I cut at spots, scars, anything that I deem unnecessary.

This was made very apparent to the disability assessor, when I tried to explain things and just couldn't. I was left in such a state after that assessment meeting. I am so grateful for the person I saw for being so caring and understanding.

I have found that very little keeps me going at the moment. I am trying so hard, but cannot cope. My HMS leads me to sometimes needing a walking stick. It's embarrassing. I want to end everything and just make this constant sensation of failure and hell end.

I have a wife. I have an aunt with two little boys that think the world of me. I have two best friends again with little ones that do the same. I cannot forgive myself for thinking like this. But equally I cannot cope with the way my brain is working.

I don't know what the future will hold.

I don't know what to do beyond hiding in my room with my laptop and my iPod trying to simulatenously distract myself from myself and hide myself from everything else.

187833,"Why am I still thinking this?Alright, so I have had depression for a long time. It probably started around 7th grade, considering the next year I nearly went postal and came to school with a gun. But thankfully I was caught, and sent to counselling. I've not seriously considered killing another human being (with the exception of my douchebag father) since, but I have struggled with the urge to harm myself.

The first few years of high school were bearable, but my junior year was very rough. I finally found myself and had a terribly difficult time with that realization: I'm gay. And I just thought to myself ""what the hell is wrong with me? I'm a freak"" all the time. The urge to hurt myself got stronger, and I had to up my therapy and be put on antidepressants. Around the beginning of my senior year I was in total despair. One day I pretended I was sick to stay out of school, waited for my mom to leave, and downed some pinesol to try to end it. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) for me, pinesol isn't lethal, it just makes you drowsy and nauseous. So I fell asleep, woke up about an hour before my mom came home, and pretended it didn't happen for a long time. By October my therapist decided I needed more help so i was institutionalized for 5 days. They changed my medication but other than that didn't do much. I came back still depressed and still terrified of what I am and how people would take it.

I took my meds, with the thought always at the back of my mind, and little by little I told a few close people in my life. My mom found out accidently and has pretended like it never happened ever since. Everyone else has been very supportive though.

After graduation, the sudden pressure of not knowing anything about what to do with my life after high school overwhelmed me, and I started thinking a lot about death. I had to call a suicide hotline about twice a week, and I'm pretty sure they had gotten to a first name basis with me. Then my friend introduced me to this guy. He is the sweetest, cutest, most wonderful guy I've ever met, and for some reason he likes me and sees in me things no one (including me) has before. We have been going out for about 3 or 4 months and I truly love him and I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

The only problem is I still get thoughts of death, and they seem to be coming more often in the past few weeks. I don't know why I keep having them but they just come over me until I'm crying in my bed alone. And I don't know if anyone can help me or if I just need to get it out there but I finally have something to live for and I don't want to keep having these thoughts.",suicide

To give some back ground info: Basically what happen was some people in my class were talking about someone skipping class (let’s call him R). Right around the time our class was going to end R decided to stroll into the class room saying he was in the “nurse’s office” my brother then proceeded to ask R if he had skipped class out of curiosity. R then proceed to slap my brother on the side of the head so hard the whole class heard the slap. My brother was in complete shock after being hit by a much older boy, his ear was ringing for over 45 minutes, was feeling dizzy and couldn’t concentrate the whole lesson. Of course the teacher didn’t see R slap my brother. At the end of the lesson I was contemplating if I should go to the head master but instead I went to the teacher to tell her. She then proceeded to tell my brother that he should go ask R for a apology and she would talk about it with R. My brother didn’t feel like talking to the boy as it was the last lesson of the day and was scared of the boy as he was much older.

Tomorrow would be Monday and I am thinking if I should go to the principal and talk to him about what has occurred in our classroom. Although my teacher understood what had occurred she just brushed it off as a mistake but can’t see that my brother was hit by another boy in class.

Being generous and caring is fruitless, being selfish only makes things worse. The only way to win is to keep to myself and continue to suffer.

Life isn't worth suffering over. Only the strong succeed and I've tried so hard to be strong but that's not who I am. I've accepted my inferiority complex as a fact of life and I can't deny what I am anymore. I feel more than I'm supposed to; I'm too sensitive. I'm naive. I'm a fool. I'm stupid. I'm unattractive. I'm never good enough. I'm constantly in fear. I'm constantly withdrawn. Living hasn't been comfortable in months.

There was a point when I was happy but it was gone as quick as it came, and I can never get it back. I thought I found someone who cared. I thought I found someone I could depend on, someone I felt safe with. Someone I could trust. Someone I could have fun and be happy with.

I depended on her attention too much. She was so good to me but I was so insecure, she found someone else to love and it hurt so much. I tried so hard to stay friends with her but I was filled with sadness, guilt, and self-loathing. It annoyed her, it hurt her. I felt so much but she didn't feel anything. Now we can't even be friends and that hurts the most.

But it isn't her fault that I feel this way. None of it's her fault. It's all my fault. If I had loved myself and been more confident and more interesting maybe I could have kept her attention and we could have at the very least stayed friends. But I was too greedy. I wanted someone to depend on, someone I could be intimate with for once in my life. I was selfish and I hurt her by hating myself and her leaving because of it was fulfilling the worst fear I've ever had.

I can't love myself. There's no way to rationalize it, there never has been, I've been in denial until now. I have nothing but hate for myself and there's nothing I can do to change that. I don't have the willpower anymore. I don't have any confidence anymore. I can't do it. I'm never going to be happy. I'm never going to love and be loved.

I tried to go back to being a gay guy, I downloaded grindr and used a pic of when i had muscles and it seems like even isn’t enough to attract men. I do get some but not alone and idk if it’s because im black and this is a primarily white region idk. I made a fake profile and used a app to change my skin color and within an hour so much messages.

I work a crappy job dishwashing because Portland is like a restaurant town and i needed money but i hate it. Especially now that its cold... I feel like i dont belong anywhere. I’ve always felt this way since i was 10. That was honestly the last time i was somewhat happy.

I think im done trying, I’ll either kill myself or just buy a plane ticket to somewhere warm and idk try again or just wander

331330,"I have to die. There is no way to get through this besides death.I cant hold on much longer, and even then soon thats not going to be enough. I had my first real depression at 16 begining sophmore year. I absolutely hated public school and couldnt take it anymore. I would have rather died or take whatever consequence over going. But my parents supported me, got me counseling as soon as they could and got me into a ged program for school which was the best way for me to learn and i ended up graduating with my ged that same year. My depression was completely gone at this point, and 4 months later my parents want to move 20 minutes away to the town my dads resturant is to be closer to work, which is a small ass town with only about 7k people in it and hardly anything that isnt a bar or resturant or bank. I was pretty excited for the move at first, as i could walk to and work at my dads resturant almost everyday and just general excitement about moving into a new and better house. But it ended up being the worst thing to happen to me, i didnt realize how miserable this town would be for a 17-18 year old with no license and no friends. I worked at my dads resturant around 20 hours a week for about half a year after moving, and for the first couple months i saved most of it but after, i spent every single dollar earned on weed. I had literally nothing else to spend it on that wasent food, bowling, or clothes and the closest thing i could save for was getting my license which was 6 months away. I moved 35 minutes away from the town closest to where i previously lived and where all of my friends and school was, and none of them having a license and a car at the time. Ive been here for over a year now and STILL havent made any friends that arent a coworker (they arent very fond of me. I couldnt get yo know them outside of work) despite alot of effort. There was nothing else to do but work, come home, smoke and play games. At first i was fine with it, but as those first six months went by it got really stale and i started to fall into depression again. I worked less and less, when i had weed working felt pointless because its just weed money and i would rather just stay home and smoke. But then when i ran out, i would actually go most days im supposed to but it would still felt pointless because i would have to work but wouldnt get paid untill the friday of the next week and work just to come home after and have literally nothing to do but play the same games. And then just spend what i earn on weed again anyway. Eventually, i stopped working completely. So because i made 0 actual friends in this town , i still couldnt get my license because i never got to do drivers ed, and still none of my friends owned a car and a license all i could do was sit home. Almost all day everday. Everyday felt worse and worse. I got to a point where i would do something i never imagined i could ever do, but i didnt care anymore, whatever would help me feel better or just numb me i will take. Ive stolen over 500$ worth of money and things and countless amount of alcohol from my parents, which they expect me to eventually pay all back. I feel obligated to.... Ive lost all motivation. Entirely. I never shower anymore, never take care of myself, dont eat a third of what a average person should be eating. My life is going to be straight suffering in this place untill i move out or am kicked out.  But i have 0 intrest in going back to work or just living as a human being as long as i live here, and if i did i would still have to pay back the money i stole. I turned 18 last month and just got caught stealing another 120 from my parents last week, they already told me i was on thin ice with me stealing from them , theres almost no way its not the last straw. They already told me i have to pay rent once im 18 but havent made me yet. Its only a matter of time before im kicked out, i have no place to go, no experience,no motivation, no will to live. Nothing makes me happy or excited anymore. Not even getting high or anything when i am high. Im a piece of shit who would steal from the people who have gave me everything ive ever needed and supported me through everything. Theres just no other way around this i have to die. Im not mentally strong enough to make it in this world. Ive battled this for almost a year and its the exact same thing it was when it started. I have no strive or motivation for my dreams and for what i need to do to live. Im waiting untill after christmas for the sake of my family and maybe ill find a solution before i end it. I doubt it.

226844,"Losing a lotYou know, this is probably one of the only places I've been able to really talk about this. When I was younger, I over heard this conversation between two older kids. One kid asked what would happen if he committed suicide. The other said that he'd fail at it and be driven to the hospital and be saved. Then He'd be sent to an insane asylum where they would begin injecting him with hundreds of needles that would make him go all, ""blah!""

While I understand he was probably wrong about that, it made me think as I began having these thoughts recently. As much as my school encourages us to talk to our counselors about these sorts of issues I don't really know what happens when you tell them. I did a bit of research and found out several things. I still don't know everything that happens, but I did discover that they will ALWAYS inform the parent when the student is at risk of self harm. While I understand that idea in principal, it ultimately was the reason I decided I must hide this from everyone at all cost. It also made me decide to take the proper steps to make this reddit post anonymously as I was beginning to feel I needed an outlet just without the consequences. So I thought you know, people who do things anonymously online can do them without consequences. Which, I guess the reason I never told anyone non-anonymously was because I was afraid of consequences.

Now let me explain a few things. I am told by many people that I am a very smart guy. I've gotten awards, I've helped out students who were struggling with subjects, I also applied to the Math Honor Society for senior year. I'm very smart, that's what my mom tells her friends all the time.

But then, during senior year, about a million things happened all at once. First, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Which was bad enough, but within the same month my grandfather (same side) was diagnosed with stage 2 dementia. My brother was sent to the side of the country they were to take care of them, and gave me horror stories over discord about how my grandfather tried to go to the store, got lost and took a nap in a parking lot. On top of that, my grandfather had always been a complete narcissist and manipulated my grandmother at every turn. It reached a point where he could do it despite his dementia. As a result, he was able to keep her from getting him the treatments he needed to slow down the progression of his dementia (It was already approaching stage 3). Not to mention, he argued with my brother a lot. At one point, in a meeting with our grandmother's doctor, she (the doctor) was talking to and asking my brother questions, while my grandfather sat there quietly only to scream at my brother right afterwards. My brother eventually returned home in an extremely bad mood after spending months getting belittled. (Also, I remembered this after writing this paragraph, wasn't sure where to put it, but my grandmother actually knew about her cancer years ago when it was in stage 1. My grandfather however, told her to stop going to chemo and to stop taking her meds. She listened, and now the cancer's at stage 4.)

There was also a lot of other things but, that was most of where my stress came from. My house almost burned down this year too, but that strangely blew over fairly quickly. Also, I was sick with the flu for over a week. It was so bad I couldn't even walk properly due to pure exhaustion. Being home for over a week caused me to miss a lot of material which set me back significantly. Guess that's a bit bigger.

Now on to the other stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

With all this going on, my parents encouraged me to just ignore all of it and go on with school. I agreed with it, but I could never really stop thinking about it. I couldn't stand the fact that my grandfather was abusing my grandmother. I told teachers about the stuff a little bit, but I always left out big parts (like my grandfather being a jerk). They'd often give me sympathy and would give me a little help (like accepting really late work). But I was still really tired. I was barely making it through.

Then, I kind of broke down once I heard a certain story. My grandfather had finally (after a long wait) been sent to a hospital where they were giving him treatments for dementia. But then, my grandfather basically gave my grandmother the puppy dog eyes and she brought him back home. At that point he really didn't want to leave and, since my grandmother was the POA we couldn't force him to leave. If he didn't return to the hospital though, the insurance wouldn't pay for the time he'd already spent in there.

When I heard that, I kind of lost it. I stopped turning in work all together. There were only a few weeks left before seniors graduated anyways so, there wasn't much left to do. But I was just to taken aback. I couldn't really breath anymore.

Then, my interim report card came in the mail, and I picked it and read it and then decided to hide it. It was the first time I'd really done that. But then, I realized, my parents would learn about the grades eventually. Mainly because I was already convinced I was being kicked from the Math Honor Society. I wasn't really feeling bad about leaving it though, but I was afraid my parents would look down on me.

However, that wasn't how my parents learned, the way they learned was (At least I thought so) far worse. My counselor set up a 504 meeting to discuss college accommodations. We were looking over a lot of teacher reports from this year, and my parents were taken aback by all the comments on how often I was turning stuff in. Eventually my counselor decided that they should know my grades so she printed a copy for each person in the meeting. Then, the secret was out. my quarter grades had dropped insanely low. A lot of which was due to a lack of work turned in. My parents began to look at me with disgust. Now they didn't yell at me or anything, they just looked horrified. My dad began to tell me the importance of turning things in. I saw how they looked at me, and I cannot really describe how ashamed I was in that moment.

When my dad got home that day, he continued to pressure me into doing homework. At that point, I strangely didn't do anything at that point. I don't entirely know why. I didn't play games, I didn't even watch youtube or read reddit posts. I just laid there in bed, my phone beside me charging.

Once everyone had gone to bed, I arose. I entered the kitchen and got a knife and went down to the basement so no one would be woken up by anything falling. Up to that point, I had researched human anatomy so I knew where the arteries were. I also knew where bones were and knew which arteries were the easiest to reach. For your information, the artery in you wrist (the one commonly attempted to reach by those attempting suicide) is actually well protected by your bones so it's actually not very optimal. I held the knife up to the artery I chose and was ready to cut. No one saw me there, no one would have been able to see me, and since I would be cutting an artery I would be dead in minutes. Long before anyone would have been able to find me.

Then, I stop. I take the knife upstairs, put it away, and go back to bed. I'm not quite sure why I stopped, but I did.

My dad continued to remind me over the next couple of weeks and I wondered if I should have carried through with it. My dad reminded me every five minutes (I kid you not) that I needed to do my homework and I was still second guessing myself, wondering if I should try again. My dad also told me I should do my homework during the 10 minute break of the AP exam. Now for those who don't know, you aren't supposed to touch any of your things during the break. If I even attempted to do that, at best I'd have my scores canceled. I did try telling my dad this, but he got angry, saying I should stop trying to put it off.

Then during the weekend, I stopped eating. I wasn't trying to protest or anything, I just wasn't hungry. My dad asked me why I was doing this, I then tried to make it clear I didn't want to talk. He got mad and told me I should learn some respect. Then he reminded me about my homework. I also contacted my D&amp;D group and told them I wouldn't be able to make it to the session.

A few weeks ago, I graduated without completing all my homework. Now, the high school is requesting I grant permission to send my final quarter grades to my college and I need to approve it. But I'm scared if I do that, they'll think I got lazy at the last minute.

I haven't told anyone about all this, the stuff I tried to do. I was thinking of attempting the thing again. Also, I know people are going to tell me to tell someone like maybe the school counselor. But I don't want them to know because they'll tell my parents and I don't want them to know about how I am. I know that they aren't going to learn it if I post here which was my idea.

Anyways, I apologize for how long this turned out to be. I partly just needed this off my chest. I was going to post on r/offmychest but I realized the part about the suicide attempt probably made it more suited for this subreddit.",suicide

91647,"How much longer?How much longer do I have to go through hell all alone? I have been struggling w/ depression for a while now. Here's mainly why: in kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grade I had no friends. Near 2nd grade, my dad had a stroke our family basically became poor. We are financially stable now, but still have debts to pay... Anyway, after that my life became a living hell. I have a psychopath mother (physical is only one kind of abuse.) Then I got a dick of a stepfather. Everyone bullied me, I had no friends, and I couldn't stand up for myself. This lasted for 4 long years. Emotional abuse, Emotional bullying, and mental scarring. some people think that mental abuse is nothing near aas a bad as physical abuse. They are so wrong. Both leave scars that never fully heal. In middle school, everyone talked trash behind my back and I was lonely. I had no friends and the living hell I was in became even worse. The internet was my only safehaven, and I became AMAZING at video games but that is not really relavent. It became my only safehaven,and it it was not for the internet, I honestly probably would have killed myself. In middle school, I got cheated on, abused, emotionally crushed, and emotionally scarred by 4 ""girlfriends."" 2 were dared to be with me and the other two just wanted to mess with me. So, here I am all alone. In 9th grade. I have no one. No one loves me, and that hurts. I need someone there for me. I tried to find someone on suicide watch that fits the description of who I would want to be with, but to no avail. I'm 14 and I'm a guy. It's hard (for me at least) to find a girl on suicide watch at all. Let alone one that is also 14. Nobody here is in my age group, so it's difficult to find anyone. Even on a subreddit DEDICATED to depression, I have a hard time finding someone. I am sure there is someone out there for me, but how far do I have to search!? Every single day is a hell and I can't escape from it. I can never find anyone. I've tried talking to people in class, but nobody likes me. I will never give in this living hell, but I don't want to be IN a living hell. So, here I am. This is a desperate plee for anyone to talk to me, before I retreat into the darkness and force myself to go forward into the hell. The closer I get to the core, the hotter it gets. I doubt anyone will be here for me, or even bother responding, but I might as well try. It has never worked before, and it probably won't work now, but I'll be DAMNED if I stop trying. Please. Anyone. P.M. me. I want to talk to someone, get to know someone. Have any interaction whatever with another human being, even if it is limited to being behind a screen. I have no microphone, so I am stuck to text chat unfortunately. It probably won't even matter anyway. For reference, I am a 14 year old Caucasian (White) male. All I can do now is wait. again....

somewhat high email....

So I was a naturally sensitive, very shy, skinny kid. Despite my shyness I was very talkative at times and otherwise fairly 'normal' in elementary school. In middle school, like most people, I started to be become more self conscious. So that and my extreme skinniness and lateness to puberty...and an always at least somewhat dysfunctional childhood (a special needs brother with behavioral problems; a crazy mom and an alcoholic father) with significant dysfunction around these years..collided to induce significant social anxiety. In the sixth grade, unless everyone was doing work or listening to the teacher lecture, I was nearly constantly fight or flightly socially anxious and shy. Saying things aloud in class, presentations, talking to people, walking in the hallways, etc. were all terribly 'scary'.

In the seventh grade, even despite my skinniness and lateness to puberty (which was all the more apparent one year later), and even despite significant family dysfunction, I was starting to overcome my natural shyness. In some classes and situations I was still very quiet and shy, but in others i was normally talkative and sometimes even class clownish. I was the most 'well liked' in my main circle of friends, and I had a wide variety of other friends, including the nerds, the 'losers', and some of the future 'jocks'.

Then late seventh grade/early eighth grade mom moved out (and did crazy things, e.g. aunt kelly fighting... I don't know who did this, but I found a picture of me at I think grandmother's house that had been torn up) and then dad filed for divorce... so that, my continued skinniness and lateness to puberty, and my lingering shyness widened an ever increasing gap between me and my male peers both socially and athletically. My loss of 'prowess' at sports, my lack of friends, my shyness and 'rudeness' to adults, and my apathetic and argumentative attitude....and your being a hardworking, dedicated, well liked football player....caused dad's favoritism to completely flip from its former state in elementary school. Dad would stay out and drink most nights, he'd neglect both of us (but me more than you), criticize me, and...he was just very emotionally cold. You acted out to his favoritism/family dysfunction the first half; I acted out to his reversed favoritism (and my miserable existence) the second half. You bullied and criticized me too...jokingly though.

So I guess all of that induced a schizoid state. I became detached from myself/my emotions and the outside world. I talked to almost no one at school, I didn't pay attention to my teachers or any of my work...I just played video games/browsed unproductively online. I didn't even understand people on a basic level... I actively (though not really consciously) ignored almost everything: directions, names of restaurants/stores, locations of restaurants/stores, geography, news, etc, etc. I only paid attention to sports, music, and very nerdy interests like philosophy, astronomy/science, and tech stuff. Of course, I followed these interests pretty lazily. I had very little interest in making friends or overcoming the problems I didn't care about or fully see, I had very, very few (and none of them at all serious) crushes... I was just emotionally dead, bored, and really, really apathetic about everything that didn't fully interest me...in my world.

Then the perfect storm at [my college] happened. Temporary shy RA roommate at first; then a guy from [my high school] and a friendless nerd for new and permanent roommates? Dancing in front of hundreds of people with nothing on but really short shorts is how most people find their main group of friends at [my college]? And I lived in the extroverted party dorm when I would have been much better off in the nerd/hippy dorm.

My general knowledge is laughable. I really don't have many interests (the only thing I know at all reasonably well is music). I've just spent the last eight years of my life (and the last two to three most significantly) in an apathetic state doing nothing remotely productive, rotting my brain away. My personality died a long time ago. It's very abrupt, cold, bland... I think it's partly like this because I subconsciously experientially found acting like that to be the least rude and most effective way of turning people away. It's like I try to tell people, ""I really don't want to talk to you but it's not because I don't like you"". ...well, being detached and emotionally dead...that's how I naturally was anyway.

In terms of personality development, social skills, experience, knowledge, skills, interests, etc. I'm basically a shy 7th grader who just jumped into a 21 year old's body...who happens to mumble (my hearing problems were also fantastically fortunate) and who happens to be really skinny...and who happens to be mildly to moderately depressed.

I'm a giant cosmic joke. I've had a really bad childhood and I'm a naturally very shy and weak person...and spoiled. Mom has always spoiled us and I was dad's favorite the first half. And most things came easily to me. I was good at sports; I could think and work far faster than nearly everyone else; I was a top seated trumpet player despite hardly ever practicing or trying in class; people have always actively tried to become friends with me, doing 'all the work'. I was used to getting things without much effort.

Put a naturally shy, sensitive, weak, and spoiled child in my situation...and I guess utterly quitting life is a plausible outcome. I think your being a ridiculously talented, well-liked, basically perfect person in junior high and high school might have disturbed my motivation even more.

shy, weak, spoiled person in a schizoid state + alcoholic, emotionally cold/neglectful/critical single dad; crazy mom; insane fighting; special needs brother with behavioral problems; perfect brother = quitting life for quite awhile

It took shrooms to finally become psychologically normal. I don't think I ever would have fully gotten here on my own.

But now I'm in a horrendously ugly position in life with my new, normal desires and concerns.

I'm so much dumber than I should be. I'm an undeveloped and dumb schizoid spock person (nearly all schizoid-like people are intelligent; I'm barely if at all smart enough to be considered intelligent) who's made poor grades in college, has no friends (besides [mutual friend] and [mutual friend] who live out of state and are my friends for very weird reasons), I've never had a girlfriend. I have absolutely nothing in life to take pride in. I have an ugly, damaged, just really, really messed up personality and way of looking at things. I don't know how to change it and I fear acting much differently. I mumble. I'm skinny. Everything about me is bad. I have a horrendous personality, I mumble, I'm skinny, and I don't know anything, I have nothing to talk about, and I have no skills/hobbies/interests. If you quit life and become detached, I guess that's the result, but now I actually care about these things......

AvPD is just childhood shyness that was never overcome due to untimely bad things in childhood. Overcoming natural shyness as a kid is hard, I guess, but it's not that hard and most shy people do it...naturally...and they naturally desire to overcome it. If you put overcoming natural shyness on hold until adulthood, it becomes worse with time, and it becomes a lot harder to overcome when everyone else is developed in every way and you're undeveloped and broken in every way.

For the last three days I've run for 10+ min, I've practiced the piano, read, limited internet use, watched two of your films (which i now actually really enjoy...films/novels), etc.....but what's the point? My lack of knowledge, hobbies, good grades, etc. is hardly the problem. The central problem is that I'm really unlikable and push people away. Even if I try to improve myself, my life will most likely always be really, really miserable because I don't see how I'll ever be able to change my terrible personality, ways of thinking, and fears of people. You're a talented, well-developed person, you can do whatever you want in life,  and you're still not happy. What's the point in trying to be okay at some things...starting far, far behind everyone else? I'll still have my anti-charm personality and fears. I'll still view life as meaningless and ugly and fake. And I'll still feel really inferior and looked down upon by everyone.

What makes all of this really sad is that my problems are incredibly pathetic. There are very good reasons why I've been like this, but I'm a weak person anyway. To quit life you have to be a weak person and you have to have a perfect storm of things happen.",suicide

I was just minding my own business with my little group of friends in Theater ( 2 boys, 3 girls)  and it somehow got to the point where we were playing Truth Or Dare and it was fine until my shit of a friend made the most questionable thing she could and told a girl I had the hots for to do some... How shall I put it? Inappropriate positions.   You see this was a small room and we were the hardest group to see by the teacher’s view. So my best friend and I tried to make a run for the corner chair but it was too late. My friend made it but she had already for some reason decided to sit on me.   Me being a horny teen and me liking this girl get a boner. I just froze, it felt like it wasn’t happening but it was.   My crush was sitting down on my dick. The words that came out of my mouth were just gibberish. The only thing I could say was “I- Boner- Stop.” But she didn’t hear it and seconds later felt that I had a boner. We weren’t enjoying this but she had to continue.  The worst was only to cum. (Sorry for the pun.)   She went and sat literally a mere inch from my dick and was forced to look at it by my even more shittier friend. Then I came in my sweatpants and was very visible that I had came. The whole group just stared in silence, luckily that was my last period and got home straight away.  tl;dr My group of friends made my crush make inappropriate positions in front of me.

I sit here and talk to myself and it's disgusting how much of a waste I am. My mum hates me because I have given up hope on everything. Everyone thinks it's some sort of phase but I’ve tried so hard to break my cycle and I can't.

She always has looked after me and I love her so much but she can't do any more for me. I hate to say this but I hate my life and have done for a while. I lie online to people on Twitter about having a car and an amazing job to make me sound so much more interesting and don’t even show my face because of how disgusting and horrible I look. I’m ugly as hell and it won’t ever change. I know everyone who looks at me thinks I’m a disgusting person and they have their wish I will kill myself and stop wasting everyone’s time and effort.

I am 9 credits away from graduating from college, which I have been attending on and off for over a decade.  I was in the Air Force, and got out after 6 years.  Now I am a stay at home dad with no job, no life, no social interaction beyond talking to a toddler and an infant all day.  I have no friends around because they all work and I'm halfway across the country traveling on my military wife's orders.  No family in the immediate area, either.  My mother, who was the single parent who raised me, was just diagnosed a couple weeks ago with stage 4 breast cancer that has matasticized to her bones, and its very unlikely she will be around in a few years.  I live on the opposite coast of the United States from her.  I love my wife, but I cant stand being a parent.  I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want the responsibility and the worries.  I dont like my children most of the time.    I have gone to a therapist and a psychologist, and they told me that its possible I could be bi polar.  I was on 4 different meds for a couple months before I realized I dont want to take drugs for the rest of my life.  There are two reasons I don't want to kill myself, but I'm afraid they might not be enough one of these days.  Reason 1 is that I don't want to ditch out on my responsibility as a parent and a husband.  Reason 2 is that I actually enjoy many aspects of life that I am grateful for, like sunsets, a good hit of weed, conversations with loved ones, new fucking possibilities and adventures, or the thrill of watching hockey.  However, sometimes I get so down that I run through all the possible death scenarios in my head and imagine doing it.  My therapist called them ""psychotic episodes"".  I am lost, alone, conflicted, angry, and just overly displeased with life and its stupid fucking games.  I don't want to be a part of society anymore, and damn near everything I see pisses me off in some way, shape, or form.  I just want to get the fuck out of here, hopefully with some poetic, profound death revelation, and sink into the oblivion that awaits every mortal being.  I feel completely alone, and my wife is on a completely different level than I am.  We have tried talking about things, and she just can't.  She says she doesn't have the deep questions about life that I do.  I sat in the garage tonight and thought about whether or not it would be possible to kill myself by running the car.  I heard somewhere that they fixed the emissions so that this isn't really possible.  Then, after I came inside, I took a shower where I laid in the bathtub and visualized slitting my wrists with a razor blade.

28127,"Why am I here?I have had suicidal thoughts that I can recall back to 7th grade. I even remember cutting myself in 8th grade. I don't think my parents ever found out. I am now 25 and have been living with my parents since having graduated from college a year ago. I smoke cannabis every night, rarely drink alcohol (Average 2 drinks per week, if that), and am not currently prescribed to any medication. I have talked to a few counselors and been prescribed all sorts of things from Adderall to Wellbutrin over my life, and I have grown to despise the pharmaceutical industry.  I haven't been prescribed to anything in over 4 years now and I never thought they helped very much. I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and ADHD when I was in 9th or 10th grade.


I feel like while growing up, I was always more concerned with girls and fitting in with my friends than on actually trying to make something of myself. I had some really great times in college and some extremely shitty times. I'm talking being fucked over by friends hardcore and being put in jail multiple times, on top of pretty heavy depression between breakups...that sort of thing.  Now, I have a useless degree and am living with my parents. I recently quit a job I had for 9 months and am planning on wandering the world with the money I saved from that, hoping getting out in the world and seeing things might help me. I just don't know what's wrong with me.


I act like a complete asshole to my parents, who have given me the world and are the coolest and sweetest parents anyone could ask for. I feel like I am a burden on them (they threatened kicking me out about 6 months ago because they couldn't handle my attitude. that also happened the night after I told my dad I didn't believe in Christianity. I retaliated by telling them I don't appreciate being given an ultimatum ((either seek counseling or leave)) in a handwritten note left on the kitchen counter) and feel like my attitude has greatly affected our relationship.

One of the main things preventing me from doing something drastic is the thought of the devastation that my parents would suffer through. My mothers brother killed himself, as did her cousin, and my dad's dad was an alcoholic who was never around and died when he was young.

I’ve been talking to this girl for about two years, we are good friends, and I kinda formed a crush on her, only some of my closet friends knew (other than her) and we all would hang out together. Eventually the news spread and she knew I had a crush on someone and begged me to tell her, she said “you can trust me, I’m a girl maybe I can set you up”, things like that went on for about 5 months and I decided I was going to ask her out to the christmas dance, but I kept getting cold feet, and then two weeks before the dance one of my friends told her about my crush on her, and I couldn’t deny the facts, she already knew the truth, it was kinda awkward for the rest of the day, she kinda didn’t talk to me and would avoid me , at the end of the day my friend that told her about my crush was talking with some of her friends ( we are all kinda close) and apparently she liked me back, but was afraid that if we got together and broke up we wouldn’t be friends anymore, I thought that was respectable, but I still haven’t tried asking her out so the Monday before the dance I did it, “Would you like to go to the dance with me”. She just walked away and didn’t even show up to the dance saying “ she dosen’t like crowds”, I have been depressed even before this, but after she ghosted me, it was an all time low it was like we weren’t even friends anymore, well I had to deal with that for all of Christmas break and when we got back to school it was kinda no different, every time I would try to rekindle the friendship we used to have and confront her, she would say, you are my friend and always will be, but still didn’t really show it, and then one of her friends spilled the beans, turns out she liked one of my other friends more, and one detail I haven’t added was he liked her as well, I was heart broken, I stopped talking to people I stayed inside listening to music and playing video games 24//7 instead of studying for school, I started to feel like I was being resented and hated by my friends and I even thought that she never thought of me as a friend anyway, but my friend ( the one that told her I liked her, not the one that likes her), started comforting me and I got on my feet again, I asked her ( I’m tired of writing her/she, so let’s call her piper), so I asked piper If she liked him, she said yes, I asked my friend ( the one that likes her, lets call him Dan) I asked Dan if he liked her and he said yes, I was so sad but I was like screw It lets get these people together, so I pep talked piper, because originally she was scared of what to say, and I helped Dan ask her out by giving him advice since I know her better than dan, well they did it, started dating ( even to current time), dan was a jerk to me after that since I kinda still liked her, I almost got kicked out of the friend group because “still liking her is wrong” , he almost got kicked because “ you don’t take a friends crush”, well it all finally settled when I got bored of this shit and started looking for a new girl to like, Dan and I are neutral , piper is still dating him, and I’m alone and kinda don’t care, piper and I ended up talking it out and we are ok friends now, Even though I still like her, just by the way she talks, and acts, but nobody will ever know that except the possible billions of people on the internet.

But everything feels so real, I may aswell actually have something wrong with me. I can’t get over the fact I have silent sinus syndrome, a very rare condition which causes the eyeball to sink into the skull due to the orbital bones breaking down, but there’s no painful symptoms hence the silent. It’s so rare I can’t find information on how common/yearly cases occur. The only treatment is suicide I mean surgery to add prosthesis to fix the appearance. For a month or so my eyelids have changed and have 3 creases instead of 2. Nobody in my family has said anything looks off. I’ve been doing symmetry tests where I take a picture of my eyes and draw lines connecting at the top eyelash, bottom eyelash etc. about a week ago they seemed fine and my anxiety actually kinda went away. Tonight anxiety just came out to get me. I’ve taken sone picture tests again and some seem okay, some seem asymmetrical at the bottom eyelash, which is a sign according to google. I refuse to think it’s just “camera angle” and indeed those asymmetrical results I get, are indeed from my eyeball sinking into my skull promoting terrifying and possibly disabling and disfiguring eye surgery. I already suffered from self image issues from me being overweight and just ugly in general, but this one put me in a casket I can’t get out of.

7724,"My Untold Story (Help)Ok, so I don't know how to start this story off so I'll start from the beginning. I was a kid who could make friends easily starting off and was very talkative. My parents divorced when I was three and whenever I would go to my dads lets just say he was a little more ruff with me... I still remember when he said to me ""why are you running away from me every time I get close?"". Whenever I think of him saying that it still gets me mad because he should know why. When I started to get older I didn't talk as much and it became a little harder to make friends. I would start to become depressed and think of cutting my self to release my pain inside when I was in grade six. In grade eleven I did what I was thinking of doing all those years, cutting my self, the reason why is because I had a breaking point. It was because of my mom and my step dad I am not going to get into the detail about the arguments but it made me take a razor to my leg. I didn't just do it once, I did it when ever I couldn't control my pain. If I wasn't cutting my self I would punch a solid wood dresser in my room which would also calm me down. The problem with that is that my knuckles started to swell and hurt a lot. Lately I have been thinking of committing suicide kinda of like how I was in grade six thinking about cutting myself. It kinda feels like deja vu to me, It was just a thought of committing suicide but lately I have been thinking of how I would do it and it's progressing. I also think I am bipolar because I am happy one day then depressed another not wanting to do anything or talk to friends, etc. I  have never told anyone this nor does anyone know about what's happening inside of me. I don't know why I do this but whenever I am around anyone I study them if you would say. In other words I try to think of what they are about to do or what they are thinking of. I have become really good at it for some odd reason and I really don't know why I do this. Lastly a lot of my friends ask me about advice or they need me to support them through what ever is going on. The sad part is I am way more fucked up then them and they don't even know. The reason why I have came to reddit is because I will most likely never go to a therapies of any sort and I only feel comfortable asking people on reddit. So I really don't know what I am trying to find but I need help from you guys it would be great to have your input.",suicide

76488,"I DON'T CARE IF ANYONE READS THIS OR RESPONDS TO THIS IT'S FUCKING LONG THERE'S NO TLDR IDFC I JUST WANTED IT TO POSTED SOMEWHERE. I woke up in the middle of the night, with my throat parched. I had a nightmare. I looked at the clock and found it was 3:37 am. There were humans eating humans and it was gross, but nothing to keep me awake all night. I got off the bed, heading to the kitchen, to have a glass of water; but there on the couch was my roommate. She was smiling at her phone, for some reason and she was definitely drunk, I could see two beer bottles in front of her, one only half empty. I didn't even know she liked to drink. She can't be drinking while stupidly texting her boyfriend in the middle of the night. We had to go to the office in the morning.

I took a seat beside her on the couch, snatched her phone, and raised it to a level we both knew she wouldn't reach. After a few futile attempts, she gave up. All I could think was how I never had been this close to her, how soft her body was against me, unlike all the girls I had dated. If I have to be honest, I had never thought of her as a girl, she was like my best buddy. I could talk to her like I would have talked to a guy best friend. How could I think of her as a girl, when she swore so much, when she played Call Of Duty with me?

""Why?"" she asked, ""why are you stealing my happiness from me?"" She asked, folding her hands like a 5 year old. I looked at her screen, and surprisingly it wasn't conversation. There was text, I realized it's a book, I looked at the title and found out what it was about. It was a plus size love story. ""Why do you read this?"" I asked her.
""That's how close I can get to romance."" She had this sadness in her eyes. ""But you have a boyfriend, right?"" I asked her slightly confused.
She started giggling, like a love sick teenager. It was so unlike her. ""I can't believe, you believed that"" suddenly her smile, turned downwards, and tears stained her cheek, ""it was a lie, do you think anyone can really like me with all this flab?"" she asked patting her stomach. ""No one would date me, even if they were paid for it, man, it's obvious. I can never be loved, even if I love myself. I don't even deserve love.
All these stupid stories, are my only way to feel loved, wanted, because in a world of fiction, maybe, just maybe I am wanted. In the real world, I feel nothing but pain, I want to feel so many things, but I will never be able to, because who would love me? I am just a fat, ugly snob rolling through life. That's why I read these stupid stories, because I would never be at the receiving end when it comes to love. No one would date me, heck no would date me even if they were paid for it."" Her tears were streaming down continuously, as she continued to be too harsh to herself. I remembered all the times, she would smile at work, even around me, she would never cry. She was so confident and kind, she always told everyone 'call me when in need' and I had heard excellent stories from my colleagues about her help. I never thought that she could cry, but right now, she looked so broken and fragile, I had this urge to comfort her, to do whatever I can to see her smile, once again. Although, I was never the kind of man to take advantage of any girl, but right now, when she looked so vulnerable, all I could think of was how, I wanted to kiss her on her always-dry lips, make them moist with mine.  I blinked and realized my eyes were filled with tears, as a single tear rolled down my right cheek. I stopped thinking and asked her, ""would you remember everything after waking up in the noon?"" She shook her head, I did the unthinkable. My lips took over hers in no time. I was fierce at first, but she was drunk, so we took it slow. It was sloppy at first, but then she did it more steadily, as if I was sucking her intoxication, and sobering her up. She tasted like beers and cherries, her lips, even softer than I had imagined. I dropped my hands to her waist, from her face, very carefully, as if she would break if I hold her too tight. She had her hands around my neck, and nothing ever felt as good as that moment, and I knew I was wrecked. I felt her smiling into the kiss and I did the same. We pulled away for a very much needed breath, and she whispered the words, 'thank you' and with another kiss, she hugged me and slept in my arms, on the couch. I half-wished that she did remember what we did, later in the afternoon. I really wanted to know, what she felt about it, but the other half of me was dreading for her furious reaction.",non-suicide

Actually thought about buying a gun today. I would've run my car into a tree along ago if I was confident that it would actually kill me. I've been thinking a lot about how once my parents go I'll follow because I know my mom would try to kill herself again if I did that and I didn't want to do that to my father but I just don't have it in me anymore to keep doing this.

Not 👏 all 👏 enbys 👏 are 👏 trash 👏

Not 👏 all 👏 people 👏 are 👏 trash 👏


Saying anything like this is generalizing, I see people saying that all men are trash, and as a guy, that pisses me off, but we have to remember that every gender can do bad stuff.

When guys say, this is why I hate girls, they get arrows and agreed with, but if someone says all men are trash, they get pissed off, but they don't realize that the people saying stuff like this are one in the same, they're assholes.

When you say all men are trash, you're being an asshole, when you say, this is why I hate girls, you're being an asshole.

I ( a guy ) hate when people say all girls are horrible, because I think girls can be really nice, an have had good experiences with girls, but I also hate when people say all men are trash, because even though I'm trash, that doesn't mean all men are.


Everyone has bad experiences with other people, and most of the people who are saying that all men are trash, have been catcalled, or raped, or sexually harrassed (or had some other bad experiences with men).  Those bad experiences caused them to have a bad idea of men. Similarly, when guys say, this is why I hate girls, they are saying that stuff because that were mabye sexually harrassed, catcalled, or raped, (or had any other bad experience) again, those bad experiences influenced their perception of women.


It's fine to have a bad experience with a certain gender, and temporarily have a bad idea of them for a day or two, but after those two days, you should realize that there are 7 billion people on the earth, and if all men are trash, and all women are trash, that would mean everybody is trash.

Everybody has bad experiences, and has their own problems, but we can't let our bad experiences influence our opinions of a group of people.

There are good men, there are good women, there are good enbys, there are good people.

263457,"37 hoursI do not know what to feel, to be honest. It is a mixture of stress, anger; anxiety, jealousy; loneliness, emptiness, numbness, and sadness. Mostly hurt and unappreciated. I am nearing the end of my contract in the Armed Forces. I put 110% of myself into the military, my leaders, and my subordinates. As I progressed throughout my career, I faced many obstacles. Had ex-girlfriends cheat on me, lost brothers and sisters, and lost friendships. Had multiple near-death experiences.

Good friends have been killed in action. Brothers have suffered with PTSD and committed suicide. It is even more heartbreaking when the person you are in charge of takes his own life. You feel an unsurmountable amount of guilt. If only I had paid more attention and saw the signs. He had a good marriage with beautiful children. Finances were in check. Had a happy life with the wife. No one saw it coming.

You cannot be an individual; your life and buddies' lives depend on each other. I gave my all to them. Did everything for them to make sure they were fed, hydrated, cool in the blistering heat, warm and dry during rain/snow, bought snacks, drinks, and tobacco to boost morale, you name it. Yet, here they are, saying I am never around for them. Saying they never see me with the guys as if I am looking out for myself and no one else.

I met a woman a while back. We made a great connection instantly. We shared the same goals and wanted the same things, or so it seemed. I did everything for her, gave her anything and everything she wanted. Fulfilled the voids that she had been missing from her past relationships. Then having the woman of my dreams leave me in the dust while I am away, just like the previous people I dated before, to date other people. I should have known it was coming, for she was unfaithful in her last relationship. As the saying goes, ""If she cheats for you, she will cheat on you.""

These two predicaments happened simultaneously, and the effects have been ongoing for months. It does not help that I have family members who have told me that they hated me, so I cannot turn to them. I have tried speaking with good friends and old friends. They are tired of hearing the same thing over and over again, so they have decided to disassociate themselves with me.

I have never feel more lost and alone in my life. The people here in the stateside will never be able to understand what we go through over there. Transitioning back home is worst than hell. The people I knew are not the same. I come home, but I no longer feel like the person I once was. I feel disconnected, isolated, and misunderstood. I am just over everything.

Shit hit the fan last Wednesday. It was actually worst because I had already been drunk at 11am when it fell apart. I was told I do not mean anything anymore, that I am stealing inner peace, that there is peace without me. My drunken state of mind took that to a whole new level and I did something I would never have thought of. I tried to take my life.

Fortunately, I did not, as I am here writing this. Unfortunately, anyone who found out about my attempt labeled me as emotionally manipulative for ""making a scene for attention."" I was drunk and in a terrible state of mind. I would not have attempted suicide, not thought about it had I not been pushed to that point. Now, everyone I know has officially stopped communicating with me. My calls and texts go unanswered along with few people blocking me. It makes me wish I went through with it in my drunken state of mind.

Every since that day, I have been thinking about taking my life. Not purposely, but my mind just wanders to it. I purchased a firearm. There is an 11 days waiting period, for people to calm down and think through their impulsive actions. My mind hadn't changed in the past week. Now, I am counting down the hours until I can pick up my firearm. ",suicide

Feeling angry, depressed and like I'm at the end of my rope. Everytime I turn on the news I lose a little bit more hope for my future. There is no hope.

The only person stopping me from ending my life is my girlfriend. She deserves a lot better than me. She doesn't deserve someone like me. I can't hurt her like that.

Even before this shit year, I had little hope for my future. Having an intense fear of it. Now my hope dwindles everyday. One day I might actually go through with it. I dont know when, but there's nothing to look forward to anymore.

There is nothing left to say, or do but to end my life. Someday I'll get the strength to leave this life behind and go back to void.

My parents have always been wonderful in trying to support me, even though I don’t have a lot of friends, especially not any close ones, the ones I do have are still nice to be around. I’m just a middle class white guy, no real personality, just kinda drifting through life with no real aspirations or goals.

I find self destructive practices and stress are the only thing that make me feel alive anymore. And that’s probably what I hate most about myself; I had such a wonderful girlfriend but I made all the wrong decisions in our relationship and recently lost her, and I have no one to blame but myself. Frankly the hardest part about life right now is living with all the regret I hold in my heart.

I’m in college, graduating with a degree in mathematics soon, a degree that I don’t even remotely care about. the thought of having crippling debt only strengthens the shame I have in earning a degree I’m not even proud of.

Truly, I’ve thought about suicide every day for the last 6 years, most days I wake up angry that I couldn’t have just died in my sleep. I want to kill myself, but I don’t want to put in the effort to actually go through with it. Nor do I want to leave knowing those I leave behind will have to take on the guilt and shame that comes with losing a loved one. Maybe I don’t want to die, but I do wish I had never been born at all.

I’m just so torn. What’s the point to living. Do things actually get better. I’m seeing a therapist at the end of the month, but I just figure he’ll tell me to get a hobby. Focus on things that make me happy. If nothing really makes me happy, why even try.

Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.",non-suicide

High school *is* important in your life and don't let your parents or siblings invalidate your feelings during this crazy journey we all gotta go through. High school is a time where you really get to meet some new people and learn some things about life as a whole. You have a right to feel everything you wanna feel during the ups and downs of it, and as cheesy as sounds, it all contributes to helping build who you are in the long run. But take that with a grain of salt, because high school isn't going to decide your life, it's just a time to experience some new things, good and bad, and build yourself up. Also, grades aren't everything so chill out a bit, you won't remember that F you got on the midterm, I promise you.

In whatever part of life you're going through right now you *have to* stop and smell the roses. If you don't have little memories to look back on to enjoy and smile about then you're rushing through life a lil too fast. Buy your ma some flowers, take that little walk through the fall leaves, play some among us with the homies, you won't regret it.  

One last thing real quick, you know what you're doing so don't second guess yourself! I don't care how old you are or how much people tell you that you're wrong or wouldn't understand. Be honest with yourself and stand up for what you know, confidence is absolutely key my awesome peoples. In the words of Billy Joel's *Vienna*, ""You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need. Though you can see when you're wrong, you know
You can't always see when you're right. you're right.""

I've been in a deep depressive state for months and I honestly don't care anymore. The only reason I'm alive is because of my children.

I don't tell my friends about these intrusive thoughts. I had to move to a pretty remote part of town because my husbands court order says he has to stay within the same school zone as his ex.

I hate having my life run by a piece of literal trailer trash (actual trailer trash. My stepsons room was a closet in a trailer for a while.)

I hate that my mother let her brother molest me as a child and she blames it on me. I hate that she treats me and my kids like crap and only comes around when it makes her look good.

My stepson intentionally gave me a concussion in May and my husband didn't take any time off work to help me because he had just taken a week off for himself a few weeks before that. I was in the hospital 2 weeks ago for kidney disease that I have. I have a kidney stone that's stuck and won't pass, and its causing me absolute agony every second of the day. No one cares or is willing to help. My husband had to go to the ER last week for something minor and now he's off work for a week, but doing nothing to help.

47815,"I just don't want to wake up anymore.I just had to stop taking my meds because it made me lose 10 pounds in 4 days. And I'm sad because it was the first med that I was ever able to say I was able to think straight. And now every hour I haven't taken it I feel myself going back to where I was before the meds.

Everyone says I'm just looking for a magic pill that would make me happy and that's not what I need.
 But here was my thought process today: i woke up and I told the clinic I'm worried about how much weight I was losing. They told me to not take it and they will be sending Prozac to my pharmacy. Great. I called my last psychiatric clinic and asked them to send me the outstanding bill. Something I was afraid of doing for a while. I was only on this med for a couple days and I felt the therapeutic effects. Lunch time came and I ate when I would usually only eat one meal. And then from there it went downhill. My mood dropped immensely every hour. The first hour I was angry and now I'm just sad and feeling like a failure even though in the past few days I've done so much to try to help myself but the people around me are saying I'm not doing anything. I even said I have an interview for a job where I'll be making more money and it was ignored and I'm just told you're going to keep being depressed if you keep doing this or that.

They had had the glass for over 20 years and it was the only thing besides pictures they had to remember their grandmother.

175078,"I need some help or directionFirst off Please excuse me if i have posted this to the wrong sub. was directed here from /r/stopdrinking Long time reddit reader; first posting

For about 10 years I've had a drinking problem. About 8 years ago i got a DUAI. I use to smoke weed a lot then. But then after realizing how many job opportunities i was denying myself from during the rehab program I quit (very easily i might add) but i think that just added more problems. I use to smoke 4+ times per day and only drink about a bottle of liquor a month. After i slowly increased my drinking to nearly 10+ beers a night. The important thing was i didn't drive (or so i was told) Drink or drive was an important choice, i chose to drink more often than drive.

About a year ago i noticed that my urine wasn't yellow, it was a red/orange color. I went to the ER. I hate needles, and after being restrained by my family and a nurse so they could get a blood sample, I was told i was 'as healthy as a horse' by the doctor. My response was 'all horses aren't healthy' to which i got a half chuckle. And was told to cut back on my drinking.

Yesterday it started again, i was pissing and it was a bright red/orange, i am reluctant to go to the doctor again and be charged $300 to hear 'You should cut back on your drinking'.

I don't feel suicidal, I have a job I love with a great company in the Biotech Industry. The problem is I don't have any friends that i can relate to as far as the drinking. They all only drink a few beers a week on the weekends, or smoke a ton of weed. Many of the friends that didn't drink have turned to harder drugs and i have cut off all contact.

I know i should listen to the doctor and cut back, but i can't socialize normally with people without booze or weed. And i can't smoke because of this job.

I tried help groups but all seem to either be filled with people selling heroin &amp; crack or are backed by religions that I can't relate to because of my own beliefs as an atheist.
Any suggestions?

All of my friends have flawless skin and hair and they sometimes make jokes about my pimples and how I look. People constantly picking up this topic has induced some kind of inferiority complex in me.

Now, I can't even show my full face or be in bright lights because people may see the acne. I'm taking medicines and idk if they're working or not, but acne has lost scars on my skin as well as my overall confidence.

I'm getting socially inactive and I fear walking out, I usually bail out on my friends on hanging out. Sometimes they come to my home to hang out and I tell my mom to tell them that I'm sleeping or something.

They also joke that the pimples are because of me jerking off too much which I consider false.
Also I don't jerk off often. As I'm quite good in studies, they joke that I stay up all night studying that has resulted in the pimples. Whenever some topics come about skin and hair and all, I try to divert it, skip the topic .

None of the people are remotely helpful. The people on the sexual assault survivor line just read off a script, ""oh you were abused? Well, here's the crime victim's assistants center."" and then they wait patiently for me to hang up, their job clearly over.

The regular hotline people are even worse. They all just sound bored. I tell one guy I was abused, there's a long pause, he says ""you were abused huh"" and then repeats it again after a few moments. I apologize and say I'm wasting his time, he doesn't say anything for another ten seconds and it gets so awkward I hang up.

Nothing really works, idk anymore. I don't actively want to kill myself necessarily, but fighting my depression and occasional vaugely suicidal thoughts gets so god damn tiring. I go to therapy, but even after switching therapists I make no progress. They're the only 2 free ones I can get, so I got no options there. I can't keep bothering my friends too often, but they don't know what to say either. Hotlines are worthless, I've called in the past and it's the same deal. Once someone even called the cops on me, which was horrifying and gave me trust issues.

I know how disdained people like me are and I don’t really blame people for it, I’ve often been an abuser in my life. I haven’t had an easy life, but that’s no excuse for the way I am, only an explanation. I’m an emotional leech, some might call me a black hole.

Now, I know BPD can get better with treatment and that’s always the response I get when I say I think I should kill myself. It can get BETTER, not disappear, and most relapse into symptoms after finishing therapy. Even then, finishing therapy can take a long time, sometimes years to see improvement.

So you’re telling me I should continue to live in agony, while causing nothing but pain and worry for others, for possibly years to come EVEN IF I get treatment and treatment works? To me, that sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through to get to the realization that there’s essentially no hope.

Doesn’t everyone wish for less bad people in the world? How can you hate bad people and turn around and tell me not to kill myself?

I've always been thinking about suicide. Well for 4 years. I first started because I was thinking. What's the point of it all... It's all bad, there's nothing good to be had in life, well for me anyway. So I'd been toying with the idea already. But I saw no reason to tip me over the edge of, ""Suicide wouldn't be that bad but life isn't that bad..."" But due to recent events well.... I'm tipping over to, ""Suicide sounds great right now""

I've/Am growing up with a alcoholic mother and a father who has left my mum but trys to keep in touch with me but is abusive so I don't want him in my life anyway... So my two options are, alcoholic mother or abusive father. Yeh.... I'm gay, and well a main contributor  for my suicidal tendencies is because of homophobia I'm having to deal with... From my dad and people I know. I'm currently not ""out"" to anyone I know IRL (Another reason for my suicidel tendencies... If I ""come out"" my father will likely disown me and the homophobia could become much more apparent and concentrated at me... I would likely become an outcast at school and life would generally go to shit some more... So yeh, that's another reason to not want to live any more...) so they don't know that I will take there homophobic remarks to heart, maybe there opinions would change if they did?...

there are so many other customer issues. i can't stand it. every unit is an issue with the customer. i try my best to be courteous and offer a good repair solution but most of the time the customer has an issue paying for something. why bring it in then if you dont want to pay? i dont get it. anyway i've been stuck here for almost 2 years. i hate very second of it. i only like my other coworkers. other than that this job is horrible. i have worsening hyper tension, heart palpitations, headaches, high blood pressure because of this job. i'm fucking only 24 i shouldnt have to deal with this shit.

then i get home and i'm with my wife who annoys the shit out of me sometimes. i cant stand it. i wish we never got together in the first place. my life has been an absolute mess since the moment i was born. mom and dad got divorced when i was 2. i dont talk to my dad's side of the family anymore. when i was 14 my grandma died, she took care of me for the first half of my life. i wish she was still around because my mom sucks.

yea, im 24, got married at 23. my wife's not from america so we got married early so she could stay. lots of stress associated with that, i'm not gonna get into it. overall i am extremely unhappy with my relationship. i havent been happy with her since the first few days we were together. i wish i ended it then. but no i'm a desperate moron who had a nice time with her once and fell in love. no one else liked me because i was so shy and awkward.

i wish i didnt care about girls growing up. i should have focused on myself.

i went to college. got really depressed and graduated with a bullshit degree instead of the one i wanted. i had to change majors due to depression. couldnt succeed in the first major. so that's really depressing. i'm mostly over that though.

i just hate my current life. my wife and i have been living in shitty apartments because thats all i can afford. rented a room in a house. hated those landlords so much. then we moved and found an illegal studio. these landlords neglected to tell us their kids were loud as shit and that they played piano constantly. fuck i hate that.

so i hate my job. i go home and hate where i live. i just am filled with so much hate and tension. i really want to kill myself. there's no help available for me. my family cant help. friends cant help. all i can do is help myself which i try to every day. nothing works. other employers dont want me. why would they? i have a shit degree and a computer repair certification.

It had a reference to the ancient Pharoahs of Egypt which lead onto the topic of how there was a lot of incest among the royal families and it evolved onto other royal families and the effects of incest.

Eventually the topic went onto my teacher talking about how he reached out to his distant family. He said that he was researching into his family tree and ended up getting in touch  with one of his distant relatives and they ended up having a meal together. He then went on to talk about one of his 3rd cousins being half chinese, half australian. He described her as a young women, then rephrased it to young beautiful women. Idk if it is relavent but he is at the upper end of his 40s.

I don't feel safe here anymore. It would make places like SanctionedSuicide, suicidenotes and suicidewatch insecure. suicide_methods has just been banned 6 hours ago. I was there just yesterday and now I feel so scared like I will have police knocking on my door any second for advising people on how they should leave. My paranoia is going through the roof.

I suppose I don't have to talk about suicide methods but what do I do if I'm having a bad night and feel like dying. Hospital isn't always an option. Family and friends aren't an option.

I was raised in the abusive Jehovah's Witness religion and have PTSD, Anxiety and severe depression.  My manager at work willfully and intentionally makes my life a living hell.  When I started talking about resigning he freaked out and said he wanted to help, and then told me to ""keep it together like I've see you do in the past"".  He says this while clinching his fist.  When I describe to him what he is doing that is crushing me he finds a way to turn it around and make it my fault.  If I'm such a fuckup at work, then why doesn't he wan't me to resign?  He told me there is no point in finding another job because all jobs have stress.

I have outlined and documented in precise detail what he does that is abusive and handed the information over to HR.  Still no action.

I just want out.  I'm done.

If you can direct me to a meaningful way to relieve the pain and depression, then please do so.  I'm not looking for words or other bullshit.  I've heard it all and it's all bullshit.  Give me something meaningful and functional that will produce meaningful and measurable results.

ECT is out.  I refuse to do that.  I saw what it did to my grandmother.

I don't exactly know how to start this. It's been almost a year since my younger brother committed suicide which accidentally lead to the death of my father. I always knew he was often sad, maybe depressed but since going to college, I didn't contact him much so the event was a shot in the gut.

I am currently a junior in college at a ""top tier"" university. Throughout high school, I struggled with depression inwardly. I never had any close friends/still don't. I have friends who are generally all very positive, intelligent and for the most part happy with life.

Regardless of the university, I'm currently struggling to get an internship for the summer (which contributes significantly to this I believe?). The friends I've mentioned have all secured their internships with some extremely prestigious companies. (I honestly don't know if/why they associate with me.)

I mentioned that I've struggled with depression for a long time. I always attributed to my lack of a significant other/lack of career opportunities. In high school, the former led me to thoughts of suicide but I managed to overcome it by almost suppressing the urge. In college, the urge remained dormant until this year, the trigger being my friends getting SO's and internships.

After hearing what happened, I honestly just suppressed the emotions because I knew I couldn't handle facing it mentally. (I still don't think I've truly opened up that Pandora's Box.)

I'm sad that I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm sad that I can't hug anyone when I feel like dying. I'm sad that I'm an idiot who can't get an internship. I'm sad that I've wasted these years of college being depressed and antisocial. I'm sad every time I see a couple. I'm sad every time I get a rejection letter.

In front of others, I always maintain some semblance of  happiness. Though I think some of my friends know of the tragedies, I have not talked to anyone about it.

I don't know what to do anymore. If I don't get an internship for the summer, I'm fucked. I already wasted my college years so I'm fucked socially. As a person, I'm probably extremely generic and mundane to talk to. I just don't know why I exist as a person anymore. ",suicide

Guess what my school system chose to do.

NOT LET PLAYERS PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE TOURNAMENT!

Why? Because they are worried that other schools attending state would not have the same Covid rules as them. By the way, my school has one of the worst track records with the handling of covid. They just make rules but give no solutions, shocking. But, let’s give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe, they are generally worried about students spreading Covid from other parts of the state. Well, that can’t be true because the entire regular was against teams from multiple counties with different rules! Every. Single. Match. So they only care now that students have achieved something. Just so you understand how the rules are, my school made my shooting team wear masks while firing. Yes we were indoors but every shooter was just under 7 feet apart from each other so it was just a rule for the sake of rules. Even better, no other county had this rule. So, their reasoning is bullshit at worst and incredibly inconsistent at best. That is basically their covid motto. That and gross mismanagement and incompetence.

This doesn’t just hurt our county either. They let us compete for a slot at state and only made this rule today. This means that other students that are allowed to go to state won’t go because our player beat them. This means that some kid who has worked his entire season for this is being denied entry because another student who worked just as hard was also denied entry. I was shooting for about 4 hours a week at minimum for the past 4-6 months trying to be the best I could, and I can’t fucking compete. What good are sports if the competition is taken away?

Honestly as long as they're 5'6"" or taller I'd be good with that

And if they're personality is amazing and they have all the qualitys I value in a bf then height doesn't matter.

I have been suicidal before, and have suffered from depression for a few years now, due to what my parents are saying, I am starting to believe that I have truly fucked the rest of my life up.

My parents seem very adamant that I won't be able to get into another school, we are trying for public schools, they also keep telling me that I won't be able to get a job, or be able to go to Uni.

I don't believe that there is anything out there for me now, what is the point anymore?",suicide

2) I wonder if everyone is this world were given an option to leave this world legally and without pain.   . would they consider it?

What do u think? Can you recommend any other place ( sub ) where it would be appropriate to ask this?

303507,"Why is it not today?I just don't get it. Why can't I go through with it. I know deep inside how worthless I am to every single member of this planet. Why haven't I just stepped in front of a car?

I don't want to involve anyone else in my death, but i'm at the point now where I don't care.

I posted a week ago, thinking maybe someone around my area would bother talking to me but it never happens.

Why is this the hardest thing to ask for? Why can people do monetary favors but nobody wants to be your friend?

I lost everything. I'm in debt because I crumbled under pressure. I want to try to make things right but I can't.

I want to fix relationships but im told to go kill myself nobody cares.

I just want freedom. some days i feel ok, the other days its quitting time.

I know I'll never be able to physically talk to anyone and thats whats doing it.

I can't live in this world anymore. I just cant. I don't want to keep typing the same message over again. Who cares if i do yoga, it calms my mind for 20 minutes ad then right back to hating myself

I need someone to honestly state they are willing to meet me in person

Ive been rejected on all forms of social media. FB, Plenty of Fish, MAtch.Com, tinder, etc etc

I hate the one woman I know (2,000 miles away) uses the ""you're not *that* bad looking"" or, ""you're not as *bad* as you think you are""

but thats it...you know some cheer up there.

I dont want to be alone, but i am. I dont want to die but if i dont it's a future of misery

I cant do anything about it, ive done all I can, except blow my brains out and make sure nobody ever forgets it was their fault",suicide
258199,"What else is there?**A LIFE WORTH LIVING**

I don't speak to my family. Either family sees me as ""the fuck-up"", or they are trying to break me down, or both. My dad still reaches out, but things between him and me never stay healthy for long.

My friends are gone. I wouldn't even know how to get them back. When they reach out, I just don't know what to say, what they expect from me, or how to help. And why bother making new friends? It always comes to an end anyway.

I used to have a dog, but now he lives with my mom. My boyfriend and I don't want to get a dog until our living conditions are better. I don't think that day will come.

No job, no career, no money. I've have many jobs and many beginnings of careers. Nothing sticks.

**TO LIVE WOULD BE AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE**

My passions are long gone. My skills have degenerated. I no longer have the muscle memory to do the things that brought me joy. At this point, I can't even remember what they were, or why it felt good.

I try to help others, but it always backfires. I give too much, I try too hard, I expect too much thanks... but mostly, I just do the wrong things. Recently, a man (whom I loved very much) died because I wanted to ""help"".

All I can give is pain, and all I remember is pain, and all I can derive from relationships is pain... and I *know* that there is another way, a better way, of living my life... but I can't get there. And I don't think I ever will. In my entire life, disappointment and isolation is all I've known. It's been decades of consistent pointlessness.

**PEOPLE CHANGE, TIME HEALS ALL**

I give up so easily. And I try to cheer myself on to try again. But my inner cheerleader is so weak, feeble, and tired.

For many weeks, and especially in the past few days, I've been building up the strength to persist and hold onto whatever faith/hope I have left. I've been practicing a good attitude, or at least trying to establish goals/routines again in the face of futile odds and utter chaos.

**LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT**

Today, a little trinket that my mother gave me a few years ago fell and broke. Knowing that her and I have no future together, and that all I have now is all that I'll ever have of her, it broke me - I spiraled quickly into despair and gave up on the day early on. I've been crying most of the day. I went to my boyfriend, the only lifeline that I have left in the world, and told him I didn't want to live anymore. He point-blank told me that he was tired of hearing it, and that if I was going to kill myself, that it was time that I just did it. He told me to kill myself, if that's what I was feeling like doing.

I don't blame him. It's tiresome just LIVING like this, I can't imagine having to hear about it from the person you live with. And honestly, I can't keep putting him (or myself) through this. There's a pattern of ruination etched into my personality. My behavior is on a looped track. My attempts at change are short-lived. Time to shit or get off the pot. My life is not just my own; what I do affects those around me. If I can't be/do better for myself or for others, then I need to be/do the best *I* can. It's not much, but it's all I've got left; the greatest gift I can give is my absence. I ought to relieve myself, too.

Hugs and smiles do nothing for me anymore. I want for nothing, but to die.

**TL;DR:** Nothing to live for. Consistently hurting others. Joyless and tired. ",suicide

How fucked up life must be, that the best moments are when I spend fantasizing or wrapped up in a story?

 I spend the day feeling like shit, until I gather enough courage to read some fantastic world in a book or get lost in the depths of my thoughts. I want to die so badly .... This life sucks. Every time I have to hurt myself more to feel something real. And sometimes I'm too tired even for that. I stopped taking the medicines to heal a new fucking disease that was detected this week ... Because I don't see the case at all ... It made no sense to get out of my violent marriage, nor did it make sense to believe that I could go back to school ... It made no sense at all.

There is no point in waiting to fulfill a pathetic dream. I just want to die ... Although deep down... I know that if I try again ... I would fail again.",suicide
